# Second Year

This contains all of the (relevant) work that I did for all my classes second year at UVA. 

Because each of these folders contains both notes, homeworks, quizzes, etc, I have redacted all stuff that is graded or otherwise should not be shared. Depending on the professor's policy, I may or may not open up the homeworks after the semester is over. 

Maybe later i'll fetch this remotely with `MDXRemote` and compile it into mdx for my website.... depends how i'm feeling tho.
