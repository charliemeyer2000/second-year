# Second Year

This contains all of the (relevant) work that I did for all my classes second year at UVA. 

Because each of these folders contains both notes, homeworks, quizzes, etc, I have redacted all stuff that is graded or otherwise should not be shared. Depending on the professor's policy, I may or may not open up the homeworks after the semester is over. 

Also this data is fetched remotely from my website `charliemeyer.xyz` and compiled into Markdown with MDXRemote and Next.js.
