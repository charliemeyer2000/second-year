# Second Year

This is a repo for all the work I did second year. I have `.gitignore`d all the stuff that is homeworks/quizzes, etc. Only stuff according to the syllabuses are published. 

Since exams have now finished, I have taken the time to fix my `logging-repository` to work again, so all commits should be summarized and published to `logs.md` accordingly.
