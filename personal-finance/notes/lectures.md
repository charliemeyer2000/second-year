* IRS example provided in publication 501, dependents, standard, deduction, and filing information:
    * You provided 4k toward your 16-year-old son's support for the year
    * HE has a part-time job and provided 6k to his own support
    * He provided more than half of his own support for the year
    * He isn't your qualifying child. 

## Where to Stash the Cash

Landscape of Financial Services

    * NCUA (National Credit Union Administration) - insures deposits
* Banks - owned by stockholders, for-profit
    * Insured by FDIC

### Beenfits/Drawbacks

1. Regular Savings Accounts
    - Low minimum balance, ease of withdrawal, insured
    - low rate of return
1. Money Market Account/Funds
    - Favorable rate of return, allows limited number of checks to be written, insured
    - higher minimum balance than regular savings accounts, service charge and/or lower rate if below certain balance
    - not insured
1. Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
    - guaranteed rate of return for time of CD, insured ( when purchased from bank or comparable financial institution)
    - Possible penalty for early withdrawal, minimum deposit. 
1. US Savings Bonds
    - Rate varies with interest rates (I bonds), low minimum deposit, Government guaranteed, exempt from state, local income taxes
    - lower rate when redeemed within first five years. 

### Terms

* Rate of Return - percentage increase in value of savings, increase with frequency of compounding
* Inflation - higher consumer prices result in buying power earned on savings
* Taxes - taxable interest reduces amount of earnings
* Liquidity - ease with which savings can be converted to cash
* Safety - 

### Other Considerations

* Convenience
* Service
* Experience/reputation/ethics/integrity
* Privacy Policy: your financial information is _valuable_. Read the organization's privacy policy on its website and in the account opening documentation.

    * NUmber that reflects your credit risk at a point in time generated by the CRA
    * Ranges from 300 to 850.

### What is a Good Credit Score?
* 300 - 550: Poor
* 550 - 620: Subprime
* 620 - 680: Acceptable

# Day 5

## Statements

- Income statement - how much money you make
- Cash flow Statement - what happened: measures cash inflows and outflows over a period of time.

1. Beginning Balance sheet (where you are)
1. Income statement (what happened); Cash flow statement (what happened)
1. Ending balance sheet (where you are). 

### Balance Sheet

* If income > expenses, your net worth goes up. 
* If expenses > income, net worth goes down.

## General Budget - 20/30/50

- Financial Goals/Priorities > 20%: Savings/investment contributions, HSA, debt repayments
- Essential Expenses < 50%: Housing, transportation, utilities, groceries, and insurance
- Lifestyle choices: < 30%: cable, internet, giving, childcare, entertainment, hobbies, pets, personal care, misc. 

## Planning Your Tax Strategy

Saving money avoids taxes. You are helping your bottom line! Thus, "A penny saved > a penny earned" due to income tax!!

Ex: Scholarship vs. Stipend
1. Scholarship - income from a qualified scholarship is not taxable. Amounts used for costs like tuition, course books, room and board are not taxable.
1. Stipend - a stipend is defined as a fixed sum of money paid periodically for services or to defray expenses. The fact that enumeration is termed a "fee" or "stipend" rather than salary or wages. 

Consider that if you are in teh 24% tax bracket, a 30k tuition is equivalent to around a 40k pre-tax equivalent. 

## Lower your Taxes

1. Minimize your taxable income
1. Don't receive a huge tax refund (if you pay too much in taxes) - this is because the treasury is holding your money, rather than you!
1. Increase your current/future net income
1. Pay your share, no more, no less
1. Maintain good records.
1. stay informed
1. Be proactive
1. Use the decision-making model

## Day 3

### Human Capital

Ways to measure human capital:
- Income-based approach which is monetary measure of _human capital_ embodied in individuals, based on the stream of expected future earning 
generated.

1. Gross vs. Net Salary:

## Day 2

### Your Assets

- **Human capital**: your ability to earn and save money, which diminishes over time.
- **Financial capital**: an individual's total saved assets
- **Total Economic Wealth** = Human Capital + Financial Capital

Your human capital diminishes and gets eclipsed (hopefully) by your financial capital around 65 years old.

![Capital Graph](images/capital-graph.png)

### Asset Risks (Liabilities)

Types of Risk:
- **Personal risk**: injury, illness, death
- **Liquidity risk**: how quickly you can transfer an asset into cash w/o losing (most) value
- **Income risk**: unemployment, sickness, pandemic, etc.
- **Interest-rate risk**: the risk that the value of an asset will decrease as interest rates increase
- **Inflation risk**: the risk that the rate of inflation will increase more than the rate of interest on savings. Furthermore, prices will generally increase and the value of your money will decrease. Consider college education!

### Understand, Manage, and Mitigate Risk

- Understand the risk/reward trade-off:

### Goals

- Short-Term Savings: Emergencies, car repair/replacement, vacation
- Medium-Term Savings: Home, education
- Long-Term Savings: Retirement

### Keys to Physical Wellbeing

- Eat healthy
- Exercise
- Sleep

Think of your money also like your welbeing. Calories in, calories out. Cash flow in, cash flow out. Some calories/spending is better than others. 

Now is the best time to start saving! If you start now putting $4k into an IRA for 10 years at 10% return and leave it until you're 65, it should be around $2 million. 

What happens if you delay and wait to invest? Even if you wait until 31 and do the same thing ($4k into an IRA for 10 years at 10% return until 65), you'll have less than half of what you would have had if you started at 21.

### FInancial Planning

![Financial Planning](images/financial-planning.png)

Employ a decision making model:
1. Identify a decision 
1. Gather information'
1. Identify alternatives
1. Weight evidence
1. Choose an option
1. Take action
1. Review outcomes

Your decisions could be changing from a long-term to a short-term fix, changing it from a long-term to short-term habit, it doesn't have to be a big change.

### Opportunity Cost

The costs of making one choice over another. This includes the loss of time, energy, and derived pleasure/utility.
