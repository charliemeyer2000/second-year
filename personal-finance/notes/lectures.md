### Why Track your Money? 

* **Balance Sheet** - Shows net worth; a snapshot of assets and liabilities on a specific date. $\text{assets} - \text{liabilities} = \text{net worth}$. Aka, $\text{what you own} - \text{what you owe} = \text{net worth}$.
* **Income Sheet (or P&L - profit and loss)** - What happened. Measures income and expenses over a period of time.
* **Cash Flow Statement** - What happened. Measures cash inflows and outflows over a specified period of time. 
    * Note that something like student loans are cash flows! Money comes in to pay for tuition, money goes out to pay for tuition.

- Income-based approach which is monetary measure of _human capital_ embodied in individuals, based on the stream of expected future earning 
generated.

1. Compensation - are compensation plans comparable, policies on raises/bonuses, stock options?
1. Gross vs. Net Salary:
    * Gross: What your job pays

## Day 2

### Your Assets

- **Human capital**: your ability to earn and save money, which diminishes over time.
- **Financial capital**: an individual's total saved assets
- **Total Economic Wealth** = Human Capital + Financial Capital

Your human capital diminishes and gets eclipsed (hopefully) by your financial capital around 65 years old.

### Asset Risks (Liabilities)

Types of Risk:
- **Personal risk**: injury, illness, death
- **Liquidity risk**: how quickly you can transfer an asset into cash w/o losing (most) value
- **Income risk**: unemployment, sickness, pandemic, etc.
- **Interest-rate risk**: the risk that the value of an asset will decrease as interest rates increase
- **Inflation risk**: the risk that the rate of inflation will increase more than the rate of interest on savings. Furthermore, prices will generally increase and the value of your money will decrease. Consider college education!

### Understand, Manage, and Mitigate Risk

- Understand the risk/reward trade-off:

### Goals

- Short-Term Savings: Emergencies, car repair/replacement, vacation
- Medium-Term Savings: Home, education
- Long-Term Savings: Retirement

### Keys to Physical Wellbeing

- Eat healthy
- Exercise
- Sleep

Think of your money also like your welbeing. Calories in, calories out. Cash flow in, cash flow out. Some calories/spending is better than others. 

Now is the best time to start saving! If you start now putting $4k into an IRA for 10 years at 10% return and leave it until you're 65, it should be around $2 million. 

What happens if you delay and wait to invest? Even if you wait until 31 and do the same thing ($4k into an IRA for 10 years at 10% return until 65), you'll have less than half of what you would have had if you started at 21.

### FInancial Planning

Your decisions could be changing from a long-term to a short-term fix, changing it from a long-term to short-term habit, it doesn't have to be a big change.

### Opportunity Cost

The costs of making one choice over another. This includes the loss of time, energy, and derived pleasure/utility.
