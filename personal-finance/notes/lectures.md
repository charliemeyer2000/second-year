### Asset Risks (Liabilities)

Types of Risk:
- **Personal risk**: injury, illness, death
- **Liquidity risk**: how quickly you can transfer an asset into cash w/o losing (most) value
- **Income risk**: unemployment, sickness, pandemic, etc.
- **Interest-rate risk**: the risk that the value of an asset will decrease as interest rates increase
- **Inflation risk**: the risk that the rate of inflation will increase more than the rate of interest on savings. Furthermore, prices will generally increase and the value of your money will decrease. Consider college education!

### Understand, Manage, and Mitigate Risk

- Understand the risk/reward trade-off:

### Goals

- Short-Term Savings: Emergencies, car repair/replacement, vacation
- Medium-Term Savings: Home, education
- Long-Term Savings: Retirement

### Keys to Physical Wellbeing

- Eat healthy
- Exercise
- Sleep

Think of your money also like your welbeing. Calories in, calories out. Cash flow in, cash flow out. Some calories/spending is better than others. 

Now is the best time to start saving! If you start now putting $4k into an IRA for 10 years at 10% return and leave it until you're 65, it should be around $2 million. 

What happens if you delay and wait to invest? Even if you wait until 31 and do the same thing ($4k into an IRA for 10 years at 10% return until 65), you'll have less than half of what you would have had if you started at 21.
