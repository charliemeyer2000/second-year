## [Chapter 3: Money Management Strategy: Financial Statements and Budgeting](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368356?module_item_id=843056)

### LO3-1: Successful Money Management

**Money management** refers to the day-to-day financial activities necessary to manage current personal economic resources while working toward long-term financial security. 

Opportunity Cost and Money Management: 
- current spending reduces money available for long-term saving and investing
- increased saving/investing lowers what you can spend now
- credit payments over time reduce future income available for spending and saving
- using savings to buy things results in lost interest and not being able to use savings for other things
- comparison shopping results in wiser buying but loses your time. 

![Money Management Activities](images/money-management-activities.png)

Personal records system: reciepts, credit cards, insurance policies, and tax forms report personal financial activities. Organizing a system provides:
1. handling daily activities like bill paying
1. measuring financial progress
1. completing tax forms
1. making investment decisions
1. determining resources for spending. 

Where to keep financial records:

![keeping-financial-records](images/keeping-financial-records.png)

Important records should be stored in a **safe deposit box** which is a private storage area at a financial institution with maximum security for valuable and difficult-to-replace documents. It requires two keys. 








## [Chapter 2: Financial Aspects of Career Planning](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/365279)

### LO2-1: Career Choice Factors

The lifework you select is key to financial wel-being and personal satisfaction. You may obtain a **job**, an employment position obtained mainly to earn money. You may also select a **career**, a commitment to a profession that requires continued training for professional growth. 

Trade-offs of career decisions:

Your employment most likely effects most of what you do. This includes time, business associates, income, etc. Career choices often involve opportunity costs based off of personal, social, and economic factors. 

The level of formal training also affects financial success. For example, more education increases your _potential_ earning power and reduces your _potential_ for unemployment, along with other factors. 

![Educational Attainment](images/eduational-attainment.png)

People can also market themselves with _employability skills_, also called _transferrable skills_ which refer to basic capabilities that are needed for obtaining, maintaining, and advancing a career. Your readiness can be put into two categories:

1. **technical skills**: _hard skills_ are needed for a specific profession - including IT, accounting, law, engineering, health care, etc.
1. **general skills**: _soft skills_ are needed in all careers/work situations, and can be acquired through school or also work experience. They include but aren't limited to:
    * Work well with others
    * take initiative to overcome obstacles
    * An interest in learning
    * Willingness to cope with conflict
    * etc.

A career can be influenced by personal factors. _Aptitudes_ are natural abilites that people possess, such as artistic, mechanical, or mathematical. _Interest inventories_ determine activities that give you satisfaction in various work situations. 

Career decision-making is important, and having a good approach to career planning, advancement, and change can help you make good decisions.

### LO2-2: Career Opportunities: Now and in the Future

Your job search should start with an assesment of the career choice factors shown below:
1. Social influences - demographic trends, geographic trends
    * Demographic trends - the people around you demand certian things and thus create jobs.
    * Geographic trends - consider salary levels and costs of living.
    * Cost of living differences: 

    $$\frac{\text{City 1}}{\text{City 2}} = \frac{\text{index number} \times \text{Salary}}{\text{index number}} = \text{buying power}$$

    For example, a person earning $30,000 in Omaha, Nebraska would need to earn $39,550 in Chicago to have comparable buying power. 

1. Economic conditions - interest rates, inflation, demand
    * INterest rates, price fluctuations, or changing global demand for goods and services affect career opportunities, most of which are out of your control.
1. Industry trends - foreign competition, changing uses of technology. Most industries that have the greatest potential for employment are:
    * _Technology_ - analyst, engineer, cloud admin, web dev, service tech, DevOps
    * _Health Care_ - nurse, physician, therapist, pharmacist, medical assistant, medical records
    * _Medical Technology_ - medical lab tech, medical records, medical billing
    * _Environmental Services_ - environmental engineer, environmental scientist, environmental technician
    * _Business Services_ - accountant, auditor, financial analyst, HR specialist, marketing specialist, management analyst
    * _Social Services_ - social worker, counselor, teacher, child care worker, clergy
    * _Marketing, sales, retailing_ - sales rep, sales manager, retail sales, marketing manager, marketing research
    * _Hospitality/Food Services_ - chef, cook, food prep, waiter, bartender, hotel manager

    * _Financial Services_ - accountant, auditor, financial analyst, financial manager, loan officer

### LO2-3: Employment Search Strategies

Obtaining Employment Services
1. _Part-Time Employment_: summer/part-time is important to get into a career field and get work experience.
1. _Volunteer Work_: Involve in community organizations and projects.
1. _Internships_: In competitive fields, they can give needed expertise and contacts for available jobs. 
1. _Campus Projects_: Clubs, public speaking, planning, finances, etc.

Career Information Sources:

![Career Information Sources](images/career-information-sources.png)

* Career Dev Office - campuses offer this to help with Resume, cover letter, interview prep, and helps to also connect with a network.
* Networking - the process of making and using contact to obtain and update career information. The main sources of networks include community orgs, professional associations, business contacts, and social media.

For effective networking, you should:
1. Prepare a 30 second elevator pitch
1. Ask questions to learn about others
1. Volunteer at events of professional organizations. 

Yu can get an _informational interview_ which is a meeting at which you gather information about a career or organization. To prep for this, you can:
* Prepare a list of industries you'd like to work in and contacts within them
* Prep open-ended questions
* Make the appointment for a 20 minute meeting strictly about information
* interact and talk about work environment
* follow up with a nice email.

Career Planning Strategy:

![Career Planning Strategy](images/career-planning-strategy.png)

To communicate online, you can:
* Get on LinkedIn
* Maintain a professional image
* Use keyworks that describe your skills in your industry
* Don't post your resume online arbitrarily
* Follow-up with regular contacts
* Don't join online groups that are not professional/you won't participate in 
* Create a blog

Career fairs can help, which allow you to quickly communicate your potential contributions to an organization. 

Employment agencies match job hunters with prospective employers. These are for profit, so be careful. Also be aware of government-supported employment agencies.

Note that you can also employ **job creation** - developing an employment position that matches your skills with the needs of an organization.

To apply for employment, it involves 3 main elements:
1. **Resume**: a summary of education, training, experience, and qualifications for employers
1. **Cover Letter**: a letter that accompanies a resume, introducing the applicant to a prospective employer
1. **Interview**: formal meeting to discuss a job candidate's qualifications.

### LO2-4: Financial and Legal Aspects of Employment

When accepting a position, do additional research about duties and expectations and other factors:

1. The work environment - _corporate culture_ refers to management styles, work intensity, dress codes, and social interactions in an organization. 
1. Factors affecting salary - to improve your value and enhance salary potential, ask your supervisor for development suggestions, obtain training, expand duties, exceed expectations, and talk with co-workers to contribute to organizational success. 

    To negotiate salary, you should: 
    1. Research comparable positions 
    1. Prepare evidence of your contributions
    1. Plan the appropriate time and message for your meeting w/the supervisor
    1. Emphasize the value of your work for your employer. 

1. Meeting employee needs - non-salary benefits are incredibly important in companies. this includes child care, elder care, and other things that care for varied life situations. **flexible employee benefit programs** (cafeteria-style benefits) allow workers to base job benefits based on a credit system and personal needs. Others have _flexible spending plans_ otherwise known as _expense reimbursement accounts_ where you set aside some of your salary to pay for medical expenses that are not subject to income/social security tax. Others offer a _medical-savings account_ (MSA) or a _health savings account_ (HSA) to enable account holders to pay health care costs with pretax dollars. 

Some employers offer a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) or for nonprofits, 403(b). All qualified plans must be 100% vested on completion of 5 years of service or (2) have 20% vesting after 3 years and full vesting in stages after 7 years. 

To compare benefits, there are 2 methods:
1. _Market value_: monetary value of an employee benefit, the cost if you had to pay it to them.
1. _Future value calculations_: assess the long-term worth of employee benefits like a retirement plan.

You should also consider a _tax-exempt_ benefit so that you don't have to pay income tax, or _tax deferred_ benefits where you pay income tax at the time of retirement. To calculate tax-equivalent employee benefits:

$$\frac{\text{Value of the benefit}}{1 - \text{tax rate}}$$

YOu can also calculate the _after tax value_ of an employee benefit with $\text{taxable value of the benefit} (1- \text{Tax rate})$. 

Make sure you are aware of your employment rights. For example, you cannot be refused to be hired because you're a pregnant woman or have a disability. You cannot be discriminated against on age, race, color, religion, sex, etc. Minimum-wage and overtime pay legislation apply to individuals in certain work settings. Worker's compensation like Social Security and unemployment insurance are required. 

### LO2-5: Long-Term Career Development

Every day you take actions that contribute to career success. This can include:
* Working well with others
* Flexibility and openness
* Developing efficient work habits
* Learning to anticipate problems and solve them creatively

Training Opportunities: many careers have formal training methods like programs, seminars, and webinars. Informal methods include reading and discussion with colleagues and online courses. 

Career Paths and Development:

You will likely move through _stages_ of your career. A **mentor** is an experienced employee who serves as a teacher and counselor for less-experienced people in a career field. 

![Career Development](images/career-progress.png)

Changing Careers

Changing jobs can be more difficult than selecting your first job. This must include an assessment of financial and personal costs along with benefits based on your goals. 












## [Chapter 1: Personal Finance Basics and the Time Value of Money](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/365263?module_item_id=836815)

### LO1-1: The Financial Planning Process

Both financial and personal satisfaction is a result of an organized process called _personal money management_ or _personal financial planning_. 

Personal financial planning is the process of managing your money to achieve personal economic satisfaction. 

_Financial literacy_ is the use of knowledge and skills for earning, saving, spending and investing money to achieve personal, family, and community goals, which includes developing attitudes, behaviors, and competencies to meet current and future financial obligations. 

Personal financial activities generally fall under three categories: 

1. Spending - daily expenses, activites
1. Saving - for emergencies/long-term security
1. Sharing - for local/global causes

THe financial planning process below is:

![Financial Planning Process](images/financial-planning.png)

1. Determine your current financial situation
    - Determine your income, savings, living expenses, and debts. Maintaining a record is important. 
1. Develop Financial Goals
    - YOu need to identify how you feel about money and why, and are your feelings based on knowledge or influence? How will the economy affect your goals? 
1. ID Alternative Courses of Action
    - _continue the same action_
    - _expand the current situation_
    - _change the current situation_
    - _take a new course of action_
1. Evaluate your alternatives
    - Evaluate personal values and life situation and the ways in which your financial goals and alternatives match your values and situation.
    - Consequences of Choice: _opportunity cost_ is the cost of passing up the next best choice when making a decision. So you may invest in a stock but not go on a vacation.
    - Evaluating Risk: Identifying risk is difficult but necessary. Risk can include:
        * Inflation Risk - rising/falling prices resulting in a gain/loss of buying power. 
        * Interest Rate Risk - Changing interest rates affect your costs when you borrow/invest. Borrowing at a low interest rate can be to your advantage when rates are rising. 
        * Income Risk - The loss of a job may result from changes in technology. 
        * Personal Risk - This can include health risks, safety risks, and additional costs from financial decisions.
        * Liquidity Risk - The inability to convert assets into cash without a loss in value.
1. Create and Implement your Action Plan
1. Review and Revise your plan


The three main sources of info for financial planning are the media, financial institutions, and financial planners.

### LO1-2: Influences on Personal Financial Planning

An _ecosystem_ is a network of activities and interconnections. Elements of the personal finance ecosystem include life situation, personal values, the financial system, and economic factors.

Life situation and Personal Values

- Life situation/lifestyle changes from several factors. the **adult life cycle** - the stages in the family situation and financial needs of an adult - influences decisions. In addition, your **values** - the ideals and principles you consider important/desireable influence what you spend money on. 

- The Financial System/Economic Factors: money in the economy flows from providers of funds to users of funds through intermediaries and markets. 
    * a _security_ is a financial instrument that represents debt or equity.
    * _debt securities_ (such as bonds) represent money borrowed by companies or governments.
    * _equity securities_ (such as stocks) represent ownership in a company.
    * _economics_ is the study of how wealth is created and distributed.
    * _The Fed_ is the Federal Reserve System which is the central bank of the US that maintains the money supply, regulates financial institutions, and controls the availability of credit.

![Financial System/Economic Factors](images/financial-system.png)

- Global Influences: The global economy can affect our personal finances. It is affected by foreign investors and competition in markets. For example, when the value of US made goods is loiter than imported goods, more US dollars leave the country than the amount of foreign currency coming in. This is called a _trade deficit_. Some try to impose _tariffs_ to counteract this. 

- Economic COnditions

Economic conditions that influence personal finance are:

|Economic Factor| What it Measures| How it influences Financial Planning|
|---|---|---|
Consumer Prices | the buying power of the dollar, inflation | if prices rise faster than income you can't purchase the same amount of goods/services.
Consumer Spending | the demand for goods and services by individuals and households | Increased consumer spending usually creates more jobs/wages, high levels of consumer spending may push up interest rates/prices. 
Interest Rates | the cost of money - the cost of credit when you borrow; the return on money when you save or invest | High interest rates make buying on credit more expensive; higher interest rates make saving and investing more attractive and may discourage borrowing
Money Supply | The dollars available for people to spend | Interest rates tend to decline as more people save and invest, but higher saving may also reduce job opportunities. 
Unemployment | The number of people without jibs who are also willing to work | Unemployed people should reduce spending and may need to access their emergency fund, high unemployment may reduce consumer spending and job opps. 
Housing starts | the number of new homes being built | Increasing home building creates jobs, higher wages, more spending, and economic expansion. 
GDP | Total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders | Measures economic viability of a country resulting in jobs and opportunities for increased personal wealth
Trade balance | difference between exports and imports | If exports > imports, the balance of trade deficit is favorable. If imports > exports, the balance of trade deficit is unfavorable.
DJA, S&P 500, NASDAQ  | the relative value of stocks represented by the index | indicate general movement of stock prices. 

- Consumer Prices - _inflation_ is the general rise in prices. _deflation_ is the general decrease in prices. _disinflation_ is the general slowing of price increases. Inflation is caused by an increase in demand without an increase in supply. It is harmful to people on fixed incomes. It can also affect lenders of money. For example, if you pay 4% interest on a loan and the inflation rate is 6%, the dollars you pay the lender have lost buying power; the lender is losing money.
    * Rule of 72: to determine how long it will take for prices to double, divide 72 by the inflation rate.

- _CPI_ - Consumer Price Index - measures the change in prices of goods/services over time. It is used to measure inflation on a market basket of goods. 

- Interest Rates - the cost of money. WHen consimer saving and investing increase the supply of money, interest rates tend to decline. When consumer spending increases, the demand for money increases and interest rates tend to rise.

### LO1-3: Developing Personal Financial Goals

There are two major factors that change your financial plans - the time frame in which you want to achieve your goals, and the financial need that drives your goals.

- Timing: 
    1. Short Term Goals - vacation, small debts, something within a year. 
    1. Intermediate Goals - 1-5 years.a
    1. Long Term Goals - 5+ years, such a retirement, funding education, a home. 

Within timing, you need to have some goal-setting guidelines. You can take the "SMART" Approach - 
    - S: Specific
    - M: Measurable
    - A: Action-Oriented
    - R: Realistic
    - T: Time-Based

### LO1-4: Opportunity Costs and the Time Value of Money

Opportunity cost is the cost of passing up the next best choice when making a decision.

![Opportunity Cost](images/opportunity-cost-financial.png)

- Personal Opportunity Costs: A valuable personal opp cost involves time. This can include time spent on a job, time spent on leisure activities, and time spent on personal finance activities. And it can also include physical habits. 
- Financial Opportunity Costs: The _time value of money_ evaluates increases in an amount of money as a result of interest earned. 
- Interest Calculations: Three amounts are required to calculate the time value of money: 
    1. The amount of money invested or borrowed
    1. The interest rate
    1. The length of time the money is invested or borrowed.

![Time Value of Money](images/time-value-of-money.png)

- 5 Methods to calculate time value of money:
    1. _Formula Calculation_: Image above
    1. _time Value of money tables_
    1. _Financial Calculator_
    1. _Spreadsheet_
    1. _Websites/Apps_

**see ch1 appendix for information on all of these formulas**

- Future value of a single amount: _future value_ is the amount to which current savings will grow based on a certain interest rate and a certain time period. The formula is $FV = PV(1 + i)^n$ where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
- Future value of a series of deposits: _annuity_ is a series of equal deposits at equal intervals. The formula is $FV = PV \times \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i}$ where FV is the future value, PMT is the amount of each payment, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
- Present value of a series of payments: $PV = Annuity * \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + i)^n}}{i}$ where PV is the present value, Annuity is the amount of each payment, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
- Yearly earnings based on savings and annual interest rate: $Earnings = PV \times i$ where Earnings is the yearly earnings, PV is the present value, and i is the interest rate.
- Rate of increase: calculate the difference between future and present value and divide by the present value.
- Future Value of a series of deposits: an _annuity_ is a series of equal deposits/payments. 
- Present value of a single amount: _present value_ is the current value for a future amount based on a particular interest rate for a certain period of time. 
- Present value of a series of deposits:  calculations that can be used to determine how much you need to deposit now so that you can withdrawal a certain amount for a set number of years.
