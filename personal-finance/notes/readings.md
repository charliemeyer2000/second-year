## Chapter 16: [Investing In Mutual Funds](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368438?module_item_id=843294)

### LO16-1: Why Buy Mutual Funds? 

A **mutual fund** pools money of many investors to invest in a variety of securities. This allows for diversification of funds. 

They can be used for retirement accounts, Roths, Employer-sponsored 401k. 

The major reasons people buy mutual funds are for _professional management_ and _diversification_. Diversification allows safety because an occasional loss with one investment is offset by gains fromm others in the fund. Furthermore, they are generally managed by professional managers who have experience and devote time to picking the right securities for a portfolio.

Characteristics of Mutual Funds:
1. **closed-end fund** - a fund whose shares are issued by an investment company only when the fund is organized. You can only buy shares from an investor willing to sell. Shares of these funds can also be traded. They are generally actively managed, but have higher fees
1. **exchange-traded fund (ETF)** - fund that invests in stocks/securities in a _specific stock or securities index_. This can include S&P 500, small-cap, mid-cap, fixed-income, etc. Not actively managed, lower fees. No minimum investment amount. Can use limit orders. 
1. **open-end funds** - mutual fund whose shares are issued/redeemed by the investment company at request of the investors. INvestors can buy/sell shares at the net asset value (NAV), calculated close to the end of each trading day. 

A **load fund** is a mutual fund in which investors pay a commission every time they purchase shares (**sales load charge**). A **No-load fund** is a mutual fund for which the investor pays no sales charge. a **contingent deferred sales load** can be charged on withdraws, too. 

Many mutual funds charge _management fees_ which can be found in the prospectus. THey may also charge a **12b-1** fee (distribution fee) to defray the costs of marketing and selling fund shares. 

All of the fees combined create an **expense ratio** that can be calculated. You should pick funds with an expense ratio of 1% or less. 

### LO16-2: Classifications of Mutual Funds

Stock Funds:
* _Aggressive growth funds_ - seek rapid growth. Have wide price swings
* _Equity income funds_ - stocks issued by companies with a long history of dividends. 
* _Global stock funds_ - companies around the world.
* _Index funds_ - like S&P 500, NASDAQ 100.
* _International funds_ - foreign stocks/securities around the world. 
* _Large-cap/mid-cap/small-cap_ - funds from each cap
* _regional funds_ - funds from a region of the world
* _Sector funds_ - within the same industry
* _Socially responsible funds_ - invest in politically good companies

Bond Funds:
* _high yield bond funds_
* _intermediate corporate bond funds_
* _intermediate US government bond funds_ 
* _Long-term corporate bond funds_
* _long-term US government bond funds_
* _Municipal bond funds_
* _short-term corporate bond funds_
* _Short-term us government bond funds_
* _World bond funds_

Other:
* _Asset allocation funds_ - diversification funds
* _balanced funds_ - various stocks, bonds, securities
* _Money market funds_ - invest in CD's, securities, other safe liquid investments
* _Target-date funds_ - popular for retirement

**Family of funds** - one investment company manages a group of mutual funds. Each fund within the family has a different financial objective. 

**Portfolio construction** is the process of choosing different types of stocks, bonds, funds, and other investment alternatives to obtain larger returns while reducing risk. 

### LO16-3: How to Decide to buy/sell Mutual Funds

Managed vs. Indexed Funds
* Most mutual funds are managed funds. You can also do an index, as most managed funds fail to outperform the S&P 500 (efficient market hypothesis). Furthermore, mutual funds can have a high _expense ratio_. Consider this - if a fund has an expense of 1.2%, then it has to gain that much just to _break even_. 
* Internet - lots of info there. 
* Advisory Services - Such as Morningstar, Refinitiv Lipper, and ValueLine. 
* Read prospectus and annual report. 
* Newspapers - Read WSJ and other stuff. 

### LO16-4: Mechanisms of a Mutual Fund Transaction

Return on Investment:
* **income dividends** are the earnings a fund pays to shareholders from its dividend and interest income
* **Capital gain distribution** - payments made to a fund's shareholders that result from the sale of securities int he fund's portfolio (generally paid once a year). 

Taxes and Mutual Funds
* If your funds are a part of a 401k, taxation is postponed until you begin making withdrawals. If your shares are in a taxable account you need to pay each year. 
* General guidelines: 
    * Income dividends are reported on your federal state return and are taxed as income
    * Capital gain distributions result from the fund _selling_ securities it's held for more than a year. 
    * Capital gains/losses result from you selling your shares in a mutual fund. 

Problems:
1. All investment companies allow you to reinvest dividend into more shares.
1. Funds sell annually, whereas you can decide when you sell, so you may not be able to leverage the tax year to your advantage when selling. 

For a mutual fund, the **turnover ratio** measures the percentage of a fund's holdings.

Purchase Options:
* Can buy from another investor and brokerage firms. 
* To purchase in an open-ended fund, you can use four options:
    1. Regular account transactions - decide how much money you want to invest, and buy as many shares as possible
    1. Voluntary savings plans - make smaller purchases than the minimum purchases required by regular account transactions.
    1. Contractual savings plans - require you to make regular purchases over a period of time
    1. Reinvestment plans - service provided by an investment company in which income dividends and capital gain distributions are automatically reinvested to purchase additional shares of the fund. 

Withdrawal Options:
* Sell shares to another investors. 
* withdrawal a specific fixed dollar amount each investment period. 
* Sell of a certain number of shares
* Withdraw a fixed percentage of asset growth
* 



## Chapter 17: [Investing In Real Estate or Other Alternatives](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368459?module_item_id=843357)

### LO17-1: INvesting In Real Estate

In a **direct investment**, the investor holds legal title to the property. These include homes, duplexes, apartments, land, etc. An **indirect investment** appoints a trustee to hold legal title on behalf of all the investors in a group. This includes trusts, mortgage, mortgage pools.

Direct Investment:
* Home that you can pay for depends on income, credit, monthly expenses, down payment, and others. 
* Home is a place you live, a tax shelter, and a hedge against inflation.

**Commercial Property** refers to land/buildings that produce lease or rental income. Deductions such as mortgage interest, depreciation, property taxes, and other expenses are limited to the amount of rental income you receive. A **passive activity** is a business/trade in which you do not materially participate, such as rental activity. **Passive loss** is the total amount of losses from a passive activity - total income from the passive activity. 

Undeveloped land - people can subdivide. 

Investing in foreclosures can allow you to bet on economic downturn to then clear the property and sell it.

1. Lack of Diversification
1. Lack of a tax shelter (From tax reform act of 1986, reduces taxpayers' ability to use losses generated form real estate investments to offset income gained)
1. Long Depreciation Period 
1. Management Problems - managing properties results in lots of management issues

### LO17-4: Investing in Precious Metals, Gems, and collectibles

Gold: Gold's value gets heightened by war and political instability. You can get it directly or through investments.

Precious Stones
* Diamonds, sapphires, rubies, and emeralds - hedge against inflation. They are generally illiquid. They are also highly controlled by one company, who can entirely control the market and the value of diamonds. 

**collectibles** are rare coins, art, antiques, stamps, etc. Lots of people use internet to buy and sell.

Caveat Emptor - collecting has become dangerous due to forgery, nostalgia, limited availability. 

## Chapter 15: [Investing in Bonds](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368437?module_item_id=843293)

### LO15-1: Characteristics of Corporate Bonds

A **corporate bond** is a corporation's written pledge to pay a specified amount of money with interest. The **maturity date** is the date on which the corporation should repay you. They are either short term (under 3 years), intermediate term (3 to 10 years) or long term (over 10 years). **face value** is the dollar amount the bondholder will get at the bond's maturity. 

A **bond indenture** is a legally binding contract that details all of the conditions relating to a bond issue. The **trustee** is a financially independent firm that acts as the bondholder's representative. This can be a bank. 

### LO15-2: Why Corporations Sell Corporate Bonds

Corporations sell bonds when they:
* Need money for major purchases
* need to finance ongoing activities
* Can't sell stock
* Use interest paid to bond owners as a tax-deductible expense that reduces the taxes the corporation pays.

Types of Bonds:
* **debenture** is an unsecured bond or debt instrument that is backed only by the reputation of the issuing corporation. 
* A **mortgage bond** otherwise known as a _secured bond_ is a corporate bond secured by various assets of the issuing firm.
* A **subordinated debenture** is an unsecured bond that gives bondholders a claim secondary to that of a mortgage or debenture bondholders wrt interest payments. 
* **convertible bond** can be exchanged at the owner's option for shares in common stock
* **convertible corporate note** is a legal debt convertible to shares of common stock at the investor's option.

* A **call feature** allows the corporation to call in or buy outstanding bonds from current bondholders before the maturity date.
* A **sinking fund** is a fund to which annual/semiannual deposits are made for the purpose of redeeming a bond issue at maturity or a percentage of the bonds in an issue before maturity. 
* **Serial bonds** are bonds of a single issue that mature on different dates. 


### LO15-3: Why Investors buy Corporate Bonds

_asset allocation_ is the practice of spreading your money among several different types of investments to lessen risk. Some see government bonds as safer than corporate bonds. Corporate bonds may provide more growth and income potential than other conservative options.

A **registered bond** is registered in the owner' same by the issuing company. Another typ eof bond is called a **bearer bond** which is not registered in the investor's name. 

Three Things can affect a bond's value:
* Actions by the Fed to stimulate economy/control inflation increase/decrease interest rates that corporations and governments pay when they issue new bonds
* Interest rate increase/decrease causes the market value of older bonds with fixed interest rates you already own to increase/decrease until they reach maturity.
* Financial condition of the company issuing the bond

There is an _inverse relationship_ b/w a bond's price and overall interest rates in the economy. 

Bond Repayment at maturity:
* a **bond ladder** is a strategy where investors divide their investment dollars among bond that mature at regular intervals in order to balance risk/return. 

### LO15-4: Government Bonds and Debt Securities

A **government bond** is a written pledge from the go'vt to repay a sum of money with interest. US treasury offers 5 types of bonds: Treasury bonds, treasury inflation-protected securities, treasury bills, treasury notes, and US go'vt savings bonds. Go to [treasury direct](https://www.treasurydirect.gov) to buy or do it thru brokers with a commission. 

**Treasury Bill** - sold at minimum of $100 w/100 increments. Can be as short as a few weeks to a year.

### LO15-5: The Decision to Buy/Sell Bonds


Use internet, WSJ, Barron's. 

Bond price quotations are base don the _clean price_, which represents the price of a bond with no accrued/earned interest. _dirty price_ is bond plus accrued/earned interest. _bid price_ is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a government security. Difference between bid/ask prices is the _spread_.

You can use annual reports to understand financial information from a firm. 

Bond ratings can be given ranging from AAA to D. 

Bond yield calculations: **Current yield** on a corporate bond = (annual income amount) / (current market value).

**yield to maturity** is: (dollar amount of annual interest + (face value - market value) / number of periods) / ((market value + face value) / 2)








## Chapter 14: [Investing in Stocks](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368436?module_item_id=843292)

### LO14-1: Common and Preferred Stocks

**Common stocks** are the most basic form of ownership for a corporation. They cover business start-up costs and pay for expansion, used as a financing tool. stock is **equity financing** - money received from sale of shares of ownership in a business. The price of a stock changes when information about the firm's sales and future prospects changes - based upon sales, revenue, earnings, market conditions, etc. 

A **dividend** is a distribution of money, stock, or other property that a corporation uses to pay stockholders. They are paid out of profits, and must be approved by the board of directors. Some companies typically do 30-70% of their profits in dividends, whereas others retain large profits for R&D. 

Management must make concessions to stockholders by selling common stock. A **proxy** is a legal form that lists the issues to be decided at a stockholders' meeting and requests that stockholders transfer voting rights to individuals. 

Why Common Stock?
- can lead to returns greater than inflation or returns from interest in a bank
- Investors want returns despite risk
- lower taxation for investments held longer than a year. 
- income from dividends - profitable companies will give stockholders dividends.
    * **record date** iss the date on which a stockholder must be registered on the corporation's books to get a dividend payment
    * **ex-dividend** is when a stock trades without dividend, and the seller is entitled to a declared dividend payment. 

Most cases stock is held onto for a period fo time in which price increases, and you decide whether to holds or sell. 

A **stock split** is a procedure in which shares of the stock owned by existing shareholders are split into a large number of shares. This is used when there is an "ideal range" for the firm's stock. There are no guarantees that a stock's price will go up after a split. the _capitalization_ is the total market value (current value of stock and other securities) doesn't change due to a split.

**preferred stock** is a type of stock that gives teh owner the advantage of receiving cash dividends before common stockholders are paid any dividends. They are referred to as "Middle" investments because they represent an investment midway between common stock. The dividend is higher on preferred than corporate bonds 

### LO14-2: Evaluating a Stock Issue

Common Classifications of Stocks:

|Type of Stock| Characteristics | 
|-|-|
|Blue chip | safe investment that generally attracts conservative investors | 
| Cyclical | a stock that follows the business cycle/the economy as a whole | 
|Defensive | a stock that gives constant dividends and stable earnings | 
| growth | A stock issued by a corporation that has the potential to earn more profits than the average profits of all firms in the economy | 
| Income | investment that pays higher-than-average dividends | 
| Large cap | stock issued by a corporation w/capitalization over $10 billion | 
| midcap | ... between $2 - 10 billion | 
| smallcap | ... between 300 million and 2 bil | 
| microcap | between 50 and 300 million | 
| penny stock | stocks that sell for less than 5 per share |

### LO14-3: Numerical Measures that Influence Investment Decisions. 

A **stock market bubble** is used to describe a situation when stocks are trading at prices above their actual wealth. Many investors consider **earnings per share**  - a corporation's after-tax income divided by the number of outstanding shares of a firm's common stock. 

The **price to earnings ratio** is the price of a share of stock divided by the corporation's earnings per share of stock. This gives investors an idea of how much they are paying for a company's earning power. a high P/E ratio indicates investor optimism because of the expectations of higher earnings in the future. 

**dividend payout** is the percentage of a firm's earnings paid to stockholders in cash. This is calculated by dividing the annual dividend amount by the earnings per share. The **dividend yield** is the annual dividend amount divided by the investment's current price per share. 

**total return** is a calculation that includes not only the yearly dollar amount of dividends but also any increase/decrease in the original w of the investment. This is calculated by $\text{total return} = \text{dividends} + \text{capital gain}$

The **annualized holding period yield** calaculation takes into account the total return, the original investment, and the time investment is held. The formula is used:

$\text{annualized holding period yield} = \frac{\text{original return}}{\text{original investment}} \times \frac{1}{N}$

where N = number of years investment is held. 

The **Beta** is a measure reported in publications that measures volatility associated w/a specific stock with the volatility of the overall market/S&P 

Volatility = Beta for a specific stock * increase in overall market.

the **book value** of a stock is determined by deducting all liabilities from the corporation's assets and divided the remainder by the number of outstanding shares of common stock. 

The **market price-to-book ratio** is the market price of one share of stock divided by the book value for one share of stock.

Investment Theories:
- **fundamental analysis**: based on assumption that a stock's intrinsic or real value s determined by the company's future earnings
- **technical analysis** based on the assumption that a stock's market value is determined by supply/demand, not expected earnings. 
- **efficient market hypothesis**: investment theory based on the assumption that the stock price movements are purely random. 

### LO14-4: Buying and Selling Stocks

To purchase a stock, you have to generally do it through a firm. The the **primary market** you purchase financial securities with an **investment bank** is a financial firm that assists in raising funds, usually by helping to sell new security issues. 

An **initial public offering** (IPO) occurs when a corporation sells stock to the general public for the first time. 

After a stock has been sold through the primary market, it is traded through the **Secondary market** for existing financial securities that are currently traded among investors. 

Secondary markets for stocks:
- a **Securities exchange** is a marketplace where member brokers who represent investors to buy and sell securities. This is such corporations like NYSE. A **designated market maker (DMM)** buys or sells a particular stock in an effort to maintain an orderly market. 
- **Over-the-counter market** - is a network of dealers who buy and sell stocks of corporations that are not listed on the securities exchange. This includes the **NASDAQ**. 
- An **account executive** or stockbroker is a licensed individual who sells/buys securities for clients. 

A **market order**is a request to buy/sell stocks at the current market price. Since the market is an auction, the representative will try to get the best price available to be completed asap. Stocks payment must bet done within two days. A **limit order** is a request to buy/sell a stock at a specific price or better. A **stop loss order** is an order to sell a particular stock at the next available opportunity after its market price reaches a specified amount. 

### LO14-5: Long-term and Short-Term Investment Strategies

Holding a stock is called being an _investor_. Long-term investors hold investments for a long time. People who quickly buy/sell are called _speculators_ or _traders_. 

Long-term techniques:
- Buy-and-hold: hold onto stock for a long time, making money through dividends and reinvesting them. 
- Dollar-cost averaging: long-term technique used by investors who purchase an equal dollar amount of the same stock at equal intervals. 
- Direct investment and dividend reinvestment plans:
    * A **direct investment plan** allows you to purchase stock directly from a corporation without having to use an account executive or brokerage firm. 
    * A **dividend reinvestment plan** - allows you to reinvest cash dividends to purchase stock of the corporation. 

Short-term techniques:
* Day-trading - buying and selling in a short period of time. 
* buying stock on margin - when you buy on **margin** you borrow part of the money needed to buy a particular stock. 
* Selling short - **selling short** is selling a stock that has been borrowed from a brokerage firm and must be replaced at a later date:
    1. Arrange to borrow a certian amount of shares of a particular stock from a brokerage firm
    1. Sell the borrowed stock, assuming it will drop in value in a short period of time.
    1. Buy the stock at a lower price than the price it sold for in step 2
    1. Use the stock purchased in step 3 replace the stock borrowed from the brokerage firm in step 1. 
* **options** gives you the right (but not obligation) to buy/sell a stock at a predetermined price during a specified period of time. A **put option** is the right to sell shares of a stock at a guaranteed price before specified expiration date. a **call option** gives the purchases the right to buy shares at a price before expiration date. 




## Chapter 13: [Investing Fundamentals](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368433?module_item_id=843289)

### LO13-1: Preparing for an Investment Program

Establishing investment goals:
- You must create goals that are _written, specific, and measureable_. They also need to be particular to your financial needs. 
- Satisfy your basic needs: emergencies, short term, intermediate, and long-term goals, and retirement. 

Financial Checkup:
1. Ethical concerns - paying your bills on time - you have an obligation for your credit purchases. 
1. Work to balance your budget - Do not start investing until you do not have debt. 
1. Manage your credit card debt - it is very easy to get in trouble with your credit card. Consider your card's APR and be intelligent with your card.

Start and Emergency fund
- an **emergency fund** is an amount of money you obtain quickly in case of immediate need. 
- also establish a **line of credit** which is a short term loan that is approved before you actually need the money. This is just in case. 

Economic Factors:
- **economics** is the study of how wealth is created and distributed. 
- the government can use _fiscal policy_ to alter tax structure and levels of government spending
- the Fed can use _monetary policy_ to determine the level of interest rates for consumers and businesses. 
- Economists define a _business cycle_ as an increase/decrease in a nation's economic activity. To manage your money in a downturn:
    * establish a larger emergency fund
    * know what you owe
    * Reduce spending
    * Notify credit card companies and lenders if you cannot make payments
    * Monitor the value of your investment/retirement accounts. 

Getting the Money you need to start investing

INvestment is easy to start especially with an employer-sponsored retirement account, but you also need to consider your willingness and ability to create a long-term investment plan and what you are willing to sacrifice to make it happen. 

TVM and investments - You must save/invest money each year. That way it can grow over a long period of time. Rate of return makes a large difference, too. Note higher returns generally involve larger risk. 

### LO13-2: Factors Affecting the Choice of Investments

Safety and Risk:
- _Safety_ means minimal risk of loss. _risk_ is an investment means a measure of uncertainty about the outcome. 
- a **speculative investment** is a high risk investment made in the hope of earning a large profit on all/most of your initial investment. 
- Tolerance for risk is important when investing. _the potential return on any investment should be directly related to the risk the investor assumes_. 
- To calculate return on an investment, you need to calculate your **rate of return** which is the total income you get on an investment over the period of time divided by the original amount invested. 
    * Ex: $\text{rate of return} = \frac{increase/decrease in value + annual income}{original investment}$
- Types of risk:
    * Inflation risk - risk that the financial return on an investment loses value due to inflation rising faster
    * interest rate risk - when government/corporate bonds change. If you buy $1,000 of Amazon stock that pays 3.15% interest and bond interest rates for new bonds of comparable quality increase to 4.5% , the market value of your bond will decrease. 
    * Business failure risk - Face the possibility that the business fails or performs poorly. 
    * Market Risk - 
        * Systematic risk - overall risks in the market/economy
        * Unsystematic risk - risk that affects a specific company/market/country
    * Global investment risk 

Investment income: 
* investors purchase certain investments because they have a predictable source of income, like CD's, savings accounts, securities by the US government. 

**Investment Liquidity** - ability to buy/sell investment quickly without losing much value. 

### LO13-3: Asset Allocation and Investment Alternatives

This can include stocks by different sizes of companies, foreign stocks, bonds, and cash. The suggestion for a person who's 28 years old should do 81% stocks, 7% bonds, and 12% cash. It will shift towards more cash as you get older. 

Investment alternatives:
* **equity capital** money that a business obtains from its owners
* **dividend** is a distribution of money or stock that pays to stockholders. 
* types of stocks:
    * Common stocks - provides a source of income if the company pays dividends and growth if the value of the company increases

## Chapter 11: [Health, Disability, and Long-term care insurance](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368430?module_item_id=843286)

### LO11-1: Health Care Costs

Employers often offer _group health insurance_. Health care is incredibly important. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 that attempted to:
- reduce long-term health care costs for business/government
- Protect families from bankruptcy/debt from healthcare costs

Aging and overweight populations and the rising cost of prescription drugs cause rising health costs. Health care costs were estimated to be $4.2 trillion in 2021. 

Administrative costs are also large for health care, resulting in 11% of health care dollars spent.

Why does it cost so much? 
- using expensive and difficult technology
- testing requires lots of thoroughness. 
- limited competition resulting in monopolies
- aging populations result in higher costs

How to reduce personal costs:
- flexible spending account if your employer offers it
- consider a high-deductible plan that provides medical insurance coverage and a tax-free opportunity to save for future medical needs
- low-cost insurance for kids under 19 by the government
- review billing statements for medical providers, ask for itemized lists of costs. 
- Stay well! Treat your body well. 

### LO11-2: Health Insurance and Financial Planning

Health Insurance is a form of protection against the financial burdens of illness/injury. This divides risk among many, similar to other forms of insurance. 

Group health insurance are almost 90% of all health insurance plans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires large employers ro provide health insurance coverage to all employees. _HIPAA_ legislates standards for health insurance portability, nondiscrimination in health insurance, and guaranteed renewability. 

Individual health insurance either covers a person or a family. This requires careful planning since coverage and cost varies from company to company. 

Supplementing group insurance, you can use a _coordination of benefits (COB)_ provision which is a method to implement the benefits payable under more than one health insurance plan so that the benefits received from all sources are limited to 100% of allowable medical expenses. 

the _COBRA_ act requires employers to offer employees and dependents that would lose group health insurance in case of a divorce, losing a job, death, loss of "dependent child" status, etc. an option to continue group coverage for a set period of time. 


### LO11-3: Types of Health Insurance Coverage

A good health insurance plan should offer basic coverage for hospital/doctor bills, 120 days' hospital room and board, $1 million lifetime maximum for each family member, pay at least 80% of out-of-hospital expenses, and no unreasonable exclusions. 

Types of medical coverage:
* **hospital expense insurance** covers in part or full hospital bills for room/board/other charges
* **surgical expense insurance** covers in part or full surgeon's fees for an operation
* **physician expense insurance** helps pay for care that does not involve surgery. 
* **major medical expense insurance** protects against large expenses of a serious injury or long illness. These have a _deductible provision_ that requires the policyholder to pay a basic amount before the policy benefits begin. The other thing is a _coinsurance provision_ that requires the policyholder to share expenses beyond the deductible amount. 
* **comprehensive major medical insurance** is a type of major medical insurance that has a very low deducible amount. 
* **Hospital indemnity policy** pays benefits only when you are hospitalized. 
* **dental expense insurance** provides reimbursement for expenses of dental care. 
* **vision care insurance** 

Long-term care insurance provides assistance to those that might need long term care in the event of a illness or disability that lasts a long time and leaves you unable to care for yourself. This can be very expensive. It is not recommended for those under 60. 


Major Provisions in a health insurance policy:
1. Eligibility - defines who is entitled to benefits under a policy
1. assigned benefits - sign a paper allowing insurance company to make payments to your hospital/doctor
1. copayment - type of cost sharing, amount that the patient must pay for medical services after the deductible has been met
1. service benefits - entitled to a specific hospital/medical care rather than a specific dollar amount. 
1. Benefit limits - provision defines maximum benefits possible
1. Exclusions/limitations - where a policy does not provide benefits. 
1. Coordination of benefits - prevents you from collecting benefits from two or more group policies that would total the exceeded actual charges. 
1. Guaranteed renewable - cannot cancel policy unless you fail to pay premiums when due
1. Cancellation - outlines when you can cancel/be terminated. 


Trade-offs:
1. Reimbursement vs. indemnity - provides benefits based on the actual expenses you incur
1. Internal limits vs. aggregate limits - internal limits stipulates maximum benefits for specific expenses, such as maximum reimbursement for daily hospital room/board. 
1. Deductible/coinsurnace 
1. Out of pocket limit - some policies have an amount you must pay for the deductible and coinsurance. They lower financial risk. 

### LO11-4: Private Sources of Health Insurance

### LO9-4: The Finances of Home Buying

...steps continued:

1. Obtaining Financing:
    * Determine down payment - Large down payments make it easier to get a loan and get a lower interest rate. Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is required if the down payment is less than 20%. 
    * Applying for a mortgage: a _mortgage_ is a long-term loan on a specific piece of property such as a home or other real estate. _Mortgage brokers_ can help home buyers attain financing. To obtain a home loan, make sure you save for it and have good enough credit. 
        * _Prequalification_ - completing mortgage application. Borrower provides evidence of employment/income/ownership.

        * Calculate mortgage payment: For example, for a 30-year, 7%, 223,000 mortgage -> $223 * \text{mortgage payment factor}$
        * Formula: $M = P[i(1+i)^n] / [(1+i)^n - 1]
            * M = mortgage payment (monthly)
            * P = principal (amount borrowed)

    * Conventional Mortgages - equal payments over many years based on a fixed interest rate. Mortgage payments are set at a level that allows **amortization** of the loan (balance owed is reduced with each payment).
    * Government financing programs - insured by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) and loans guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA).
    * Adjustable-rate mortgages, variable-payment mortgages, interest rate the at increase or decreases during the life of the loan. A _rate cap_ restricts the amount that the interest rate can increase or decrease during the ARM. A _payment cap_ keeps the payments on an adjustable-rate mortgage at a set level or limits the amount to which payments can rise. 
    * Interest-only mortgage: allows a home buyer to have lower payments for the first few years of the loan. 
    * Buy-downs: interest rate subsidy from a home builder/dev to lower the mortgage payments for the first few years of the loan.
    * Second mortgage - (home equity loan) - borrow on the paid-up value (equity) of the property.
    * Reverse mortgages - provide elderly homeowners with tax-free income on the form of a loan that is paid back (with interest) when the home is sold or the homeowner dies.

1. Determining Purchasing Price
    * Used-car price negotiation - find fair prices for your car depending on mileage and quality.
    * Price bargaining for new cars - the _sticker price_ is the manufacturer's suggested retail price. The _dealer's cost_ or _invoice price_ is an amount less than the sticker price. Negotiate for that. Some dealers are a _set price dealer_ with a no haggling strategy. 
    * Comparing alternatives: consider loans and _preapproval_ for loans. Avoid having an upside-down loan, wherein the car's value is less than the loan.
1. Postpurchase Activities:
    * Repairs - The largest fixed expense is due to _depreciation_, in addition to gas, oil, tires, and fixes. 
    * Maintenance - follow the manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance.

### LO7-2: Cost of Credit

_Truth in lending law_ fo '69 made creditors state the cost of borrowing as a dollar amount.

Finance Charge & Annual Percentage Rate
* **finance charge** is the dollar amount you pay to use credit. It includes interest costs and other service charges.
* ***Annual percentage rate (APR)** is the percentage of cost (relative cost) of credit on a yearly basis. This is key for comparing costs.
![APR Calculation](images/apr-calculation.png)
* To calculate APR, do $r = \frac{2 \times n \times I}{P(N + 1)}$
    * $r$ is Approximate APR
    * $n$ isi the number of payment periods in one year
    * $I$ is the total dollar cost of credit
    * $P$ is principal, or net amount of loan
    * $N$ is the total number of payments scheduled over the life of the loan

Trade Offs:
* Term versus interest costs - Many people choose longer-term financing because they want smaller monthly payments. Compare wisely. 
* Render risk versus interest rate - you may prefer financing that requires low fixed payments with a large final payments, or you may prefer a loan with a higher interest rate but no final payment.
    * Variable interest rate - inters rates can be variable or fixed. Decide which you want. 
    * Secured loan - if you pledge property/assets as collateral, you'll receive lower interest rate
    * up-front cash - can get better terms if you pay a larger down payment. You forgo interest that you may earn in a savings account though.
    * Shorter Term - shorter period of time for which you borrow, smaller chance that something prevents you from repaying/lower risk to lender. 

Calculating cost of Credit

* **simple interest** is computed on principal only and without compounding. Based on amount borrowed (_principal_), rate of interest, and the amount of time for which principal is borrowed. 
    * $\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}$
* **Simple interest on the declining balance**: when more than one payment is made on a simple intererst loan, the method of computing is the _declining balance method_.
* **Add-on interest**: Interest is calculated on the full amount of the original principal. Immediately added to the original principal, and payments made by dividing principal + interest by the number of payments.

Cost of open-end credit:
* Credits must tell you how they calculate the finance charge.
* Creditors finance charges after subtracting the balance on which they assess finance charges. Some creditors add finances charges to the balance on which they assess finance charges (**adjusted balance method**). 
    * Others give you no credit for payments made during the billing period (**previous balance method**)
    * Under the third method, the **average daily balance method**, creditors add your balances for each day in the billing period and then divide by numbers of days in the billing period.

Cost of Credit and Expected Inflation:

Lenders seek to protect their purchasing power add expected rate of inflation to interest they charge. Ex: if a lender expects a 3% inflation rate and want 6% return, they charge 9%. 

Cost of credit and Tax Considerations - you can no longer deduct interest paid on consumer loans

RUle of 78s:
* **rule of 78s** is used to determine how much interest you have to pay at any point in a loan. Favors lenders. 

Compound Interest: $F = P(1+r)^T$ where:
* F = total future repayment value of a loan 
* P = principal amount borrowed
* R = rate of interest per year
* T = time in years

**Credit Insurance** ensures the repayment of your loan in the event of death, disability, or loss on property. Can include credit life, credit accident/health, and credit property. 

The Credit CARD Act - 
* Limits card issuers' ability to raise APR on transferred balances
* Restricts card iussuers from applying new (higher) interest rates on existing card balances
* Requires companies to inform customers of rate increaes or other significant charges at least 45 days in advance
* Teaser rates must stay in effect for 6 months
* Requires card issuers to mail bills at least 21 days before payment is due
* Makes new disclosure statements clear and timely
* Display dates of statements on due dates with potential fees
* Restricts penalties that companies can charge
* Car issuers can't issue cards to consumers under 21 unless they have a cosigner or can demonstrate that they have independent means to repay debt

### LO7-3: Managing Your Debts

Debt Collection Practices - the FTC enforces the **Fair Debt collection Practices Act (FDCPA)** which prohibits certain practices by agencies that collect debts from creditors. Debt collectors are not allowed to contact you about a debt at a time/place that is inconvenient, can't contact you at work if your employer prohibits it. 

Don't be stupid w/your money and debt. 

### LO7-4: Consumer Credit Counseling Services

The **Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS)** is a nonprofit with the National Foundation for Consumer Credit that provide debt counseling services. They have two main activities:
1. Aiding families with serious debt problems
1. Preventing debt problems with family budget planning and money management education.


Alternative counseling services:
* American Consumer Credit Counseling
* Financial Counseling Association of America
* InCharge Institute of America
* Money Management International

### LO7-5: Declaring Personal Bankruptcy

**Bankruptcy** is a legal process in which some or all assets of a debtor are distributed among the creditors became the debtor cannot pay their debts. This is a last resort option and damages your credit rating severely.

Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 - avoided people from using bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying their debts. You have to pay back at least a portion of your debts. This makes credit more affordable. Law also required that
* Director of the Executive Office for the US Trustees develop financial management curriculum
* Debtors complete an approved instructional course on financial management
* Clerk of each bankruptcy district maintain a list of credit agencies/courses. 

**Chapter 7 Bankruptcy** is where a debtor is required to draw up a petition listing his/her assets and liabilities. Submits a petition to the US district court and pays a filing fee. 

**Chapter 13 Bankruptcy** is where a debtor with regular income proposes a plan for using future earnings/property to eliminate debts over time. It can have some costs:
* Court Costs - debtor pays filing fee to clerk of court. 
* Attorney's Fees - between 2-5k.
* Trustee's fees and costs - trustee is appointed by the court to administer the case.

Bankruptcy makes finding credit more difficult. But it can also make it easier since you cleared all your debts and they know you can't file for bankruptcy for another 7 years. Sometimes having a lawyer can help you get a better deal.

## [Chapter 6: Introduction to Consumer Credit](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368355)

### LO6-1: What is Consumer Credit

**Credit** is an arrangement to receive cash/goods/services now and pay for them in the future. **consumer credit** refers to the use of credit for personal needs (except a home mortgage) by individuals/families. 

Consumers usually have three alternatives in financing purchases - draw on savings, use present earnings, or borrow against their _expected_ future earnings. 

Credit can be used to buy stuff. College students are primary targets for credit card companies. Using credit increase the amount of money a person can spend to purchase goods/services now. However, make sure to consider the cost of credit. 

Credit cards permit the purchase of goods even when funds are low. They are also more efficient with returns in stores. They also are safer, as they let you shop and travel without carrying a large amount of cash. Some credit cards offer a "float" time in which you can pay off your balance without interest. Others offer cash back and other benefits, as well. Other benefits include death/injury insurance up to 250k, rental car insurance, roadside assistance, and extended warranties.

Despite the benefits, credit can be dangerous as it is very easy to overspend. Note that your credit does not increase your total purchasing power. Credit purchases are paid out of future income. 

### LO6-2: Types of Credit

1. **close ended credit**: Pay back one-time loans in a specific period of time in equal amounts. 
    * Mortgage loans
    * Automobile loans
    * installment loans
1. **open-ended credit**: 
    * Cards issued by stores/banks/cards
    * Travel/entertainment cards
    * Overdraft protection

Closed-End Credit

Used for a specific purpose and involves a specified amount. The borrower must repay the amount of the loan in a specified number of equal payments. The interest rate is usually fixed. Generally contains an agreement/contract with the terms. Three most common types are (1) installment sales credit (loan that allows you to receive merchandise and repay over a period of time) (2) installment cash credit (direct loan of money with no down payment and a payback plan) and (3) single lump-sum credit (loan that must be repaid in total on a day). 

Open-End (revolving) credit

Such as using your credit card. a _line of credit_ is a maximum dollar amount of credit th lender has available to you. You may have to pay interest (a periodic charge for the use of credit) or other finance charges. _incidental credit_ is credit arrangement that has no extra costs and no specific repayment plan. Banks extend _revolving check credit_ which is a pre-arranged loan for a specified amount that you can use by writing a special check (also called a _bank line of credit_).

Credit cards are super popular but only less than half pay off their balances in full each month. These cardholders are called _convenience users_. The rest are called _revolvers_ who pay only a portion of the balance each month. _co-branding_ is the practice of using a credit card with a business to offer points to a good/service. 

Stored-value cards, debit cards, and t&e cards are not ways to get credit.

Home equity loans are based on the difference between the current market value of your home and the amount you still owe on your mortgage. You can borrow up to 100k or more on your home. Home equity loans are generally set up as a revolving line of credit.

Don't be stupid with your credit cards, be safe, avoid phishing, etc. 

### LO6-3: Measuring your Credit Capacity

Before taking out a loan, make sure that you meet all your essential expenses. 

General rules of credit capacity:
* Debt payments to income ratio - calculated by dividing your monthly debt patens (not including house payments) by your net monthly income.

![calculate debt payments to income ratio](images/debt-payments-to-income.png)

* Debt to equity ratio - calculated by dividing total liabilities by your net worth. Do not include your home value/its mortgage value. $\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Liabilities}}{\text{Net worth}}$
* If you are cosigning a loan, make sure you understand what that involves. Creditors are required to give you a notice to help explain your obligations. 
* Maintain your credit - credit experience can effect your job/ability to get insurance


**credit bureaus** or consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) collect credit and other information about consumers. 

Fair Credit Reporting: the _Fair Credit Reporting Act_ regulates the use of credit reports which requires the deletion of obsolete information and gives consumers access to their files. You can only get a creidt report to properly identified persons for approved purposes. Furthermore, it may only be reported for 7 years. 

### LO6-4: Applying for Credit

the Equal Credit Opportunity Acts starts all credit applicants on the same footing. Creditors are looking for character, capacity, capital, collateral, and conditions.
* Character - will you repay the loan? (borrower's attitude toward credit obligations)
* Capacity - can you repay the loan? (financial ability to meet credit obligations)
* Capital - what are your assets/net worth? (assets/net worth)
* Collateral - what if yuo don't repay the loan? (asset that you pledge to a financial institution to obtain a loan)
* Conditions - what general economic conditions affect your repayment of the loans?

If you are old enough to sign a legally binding contract, you cannot be turned down or decreased in credit because of age, you cannot be denied credit because of using Social Security. ECOA covers application for mortgage or a home improvement loan, bans discrimination on the obvious stuff. 

FICO Credit Store - number between 300 - 850 that rates how risky a borrower is. 

### LO6-5: Avoiding/Correcting Credit Mistakes

Best way to maintain credit is to repay debts on time. the Fair Credit Billing Act sets procedures for correcting billing mistakes, refusing to make credit card payments on defective goods. In case of billing error, notify the creditor in _writing_ within 60 days or after the bill was mailed. Creditor must acknowledge in 30 days.

Your credit rating cannot be threatened during a billing dispute. The FCBA ensures that you may withhold payment on any damaged or shoddy goods or poor services that you have purchased with a credit card. 

If you get your identity stolen, call fraud departments of Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Contact creditors for any accounts that have been tampered with/fraudulently opened, and file a police report. 

### LO6-6: Complaining about Consumer Credit

If you have a complaint with a creditor, contact them directly. If you have a complaint about a bank, get advice from the Federal Reserve System. 

Protection under Consumer Credit Laws:
1. truth in lending and consumer leasing acts - if a credit fails to give information/inaccurate information, you may sue for damages
1. Equal credit opportunity act - sue for damages if you think you've been discriminated against.
1. Fair Credit Billing Act - may sue credit reporting agency or creditor for violating rules regarding access to your credit records and corrections of errors in your credit file.
1. Consider Credit Reporting Reform Act - places burden of proof for accurate credit information on the credit reporting agency.
1. Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility ,and Disclosure Act of 2009 - places restrictions on credit card lending and eliminates certain fees.

    * _regular savings accounts_ require a low minimum balance or none at all. They can allow withdraws. 
    * _high-yield savings accounts_ are offered by traditional banks and online-only banks but have restrictions on minimum balance and withdrawal limits. 
1. Certificates of Deposit - a _certificate of deposit_ (CD) is a savings plan requiring that for a certain amount be on deposit for a stated period (ranging from 30 days to 5 years or more) to earn a specific rate of return. Consider earnings and costs. If interest rates have dropped, consider a shorter maturity. Consider a portfolio of CDs that mature at different times. 
    * Rising-rate/bump-up CDs - higher rates at set intervals.
    * Liquid CDs - allow withdrawal without penalty. 
    * Zero-coupon CD - purchased at a deep discount with no interest payments. 6% annual return
    * Indexed CDs - have earnings based on the stock market.

    * I Bonds - Has an interest rate based on (a) a fixed rate for the life of the bond and (b) an inflation rate calculated twice a year. EE bonds must be held at least a year. They are better for long-term savings. 

### LO5-4: Evaluating Savings Plans

![choosing a savings plan](images/choosing-a-savings-plan.png)


Rate of return - the earnings on savings are called the _rate of return_ or _yield_, which is a percentage of increase in the value of your savings from earned interest. The rate of return is calculated by:

$$\text{Rate of Return} = \frac{\text{Interest Earned}}{\text{Amount Saved}}$$

Compounding - the yield on your savings will usually be greater than the stated interest rate. _Compounding_ refers to the interest earned that is earned on previously earned interest. 

The more frequently compounding occurs, the higher your rate ofe return will be. To calculate the effective rate of return, use the following formula:

$$\text{Effective Rate of Return} = \left(1 + \frac{\text{Stated Interest Rate}}{\text{Number of Compounding Periods}}\right)^{\text{Number of Compounding Periods}} - 1$$

Truth in savings - the _Truth In Savings Law_ requires financial institutions to provide information about:
1. fees on deposit accounts
1. interest rates
1. annual percentage yield (APY)
1. other terms/conditions

This law defines the _annual percentage yield_ as the percentage rate expressing he total amount of interest that would be received on a $100 deposit based on the annual rate and frequency of compounding for a 1-year period.

$$\text{APY} = 100 [(1 + \text{Interest/Principal}^{\frac{365}{\text{Days in term}}})-1]$$

* Principal - amount of funds on deposit
* Interest - dollar amount earned during the term on the principal
* Days in term - number of days over which interest is earned. 

When the days of the term is 365 or the account doesn't have a stated maturity, the APY formula is just

$$APY = 100(\text{Interest/Principal})$$

Inflation - the reata of return your earn should be compared with the inflation rate. For example, at a time when inflation was over 10%, people earning 5-6% were experiencing a loss in buying power. 

Tax Considerations - taxes reduce interest on earned savings. For example, a 10% return for a saver in a 24% bracket means a real return of 7.6%. 
* To calculate:
    1. Determine your top tax bracket for federal income taxes
    1. Subtract this rate, expressed as a decimal, from 1.0
    1. Multiply the result by the yield on your savings account
    1. This number expressed as a percentage is your after-tax rate of return.

Safety - Savings accounts at every bank are insured by the FDIC to prevent a loss of money due to bank failure. Credit unions are insured by the NCUA. The FDIC insures up to 250k per depositor per insured financial institution. FDIC and NCUA also provide deposit insurance for retirement accounts. 

### LO5-5: Payment Methods

Payment Alternatives:
1. Digital - debit cards, online payments, prepaid cards, phones

## [Chapter 4: Planning your Tax Strategy](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368361?module_item_id=843061)

### Taxes and Financial Planning

Types of Taxes:
1. Tax on Purchases - _sales tax_ is both a state and local tax added to the purchase of products. Many states except food/drugs from sales tax. An _excise tax_ is imposed by federal and state governments on specific goods like gasoline, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, tires, air travel, and phone service
1. Taxes on Property - _Real estate property tax_ is a major source of revenue for local government that taxes based on the value of land/buildings. Some areas also impose a _personal property tax_ that assesses taxes on the value of boats, cars, furniture, and other stuff. 
1. Taxes on wealth - _estate taxes_ are imposed on the value of a person's property at the time of their death. This tax is based on the fair market value of their investments, property, and bank account less deductions/other taxes. An _inheritance tax_ is levied on the value of property bequeathed by a deceased person. 
1. Taxes on Earnings - two main taxes on waves and salaries are Social Security and income taxes: 
    * _Social security_ is a federal program that provides disability and retirement benefits. It is funded by a tax on earnings paid by employees and employers.
    * _income tax_ is a tax on earnings that funds the federal government. It is based on the amount of income earned during a period. It can also be taxed thorough state and local governments.

### Income Tax Fundamentals

Americans are required to pay their share of income taxes to the federal government, which involves calculating taxable income, determining amount paid, and comparing this amount with the income tax payments withheld or made during the year. 

1. Determine Adjusted Gross Income - **taxable income** is the net amount of income, after allowable deductions, on which income tax is computed.There are various types of income:
    * **earned income** money from personal effort - wages, salary, etc. 
    * **investment income** money from property owned - interest, dividends, etc.
    * **passive income** - results from business activities in which you do not actively participate, such as a limited partnership.
    - >Total income is also affected by **exclusions** - an amount not included in gross income. Exclusions are also called **tax-exempt income** which is income not subject to tax. **tax deferred income** is income that will be taxed at a later date. This is something like an IRA. Finally, **adjusted gross income (AGI)** is gross income after certain additions/reductions have been made. This may be rental income or business profits. **Tax shelters** are investments that provide immediate tax benefits and a reasonable expectation of financial return. 
1. Computing Taxable Income - a **tax deduction** is the amount subtracted from adjusted gross income to arrive at a taxable income. Each taxpayer recieves a **standard deduction**, a set amount on which no taxes are paid. Some people qualify for **itemized deductions** which are expenses a taxpayer is allowed to deduct from adjusted gross income. This includes medical/dental expenses, state/local taxes (up to $10,000), interest on mortgages (up to $750,000 loan limit), contributions to charity, theft losses, moving expenses for active duty servicepersons, and job-related expenses. 
1. Calculating taxes owed - Your taxable income is the bases for computing the amount of your income tax. Use your taxable income in conjunction with the tax rate schedule to determine the amount of tax owed. Each of the tax rates represents a range of income levels. these are called _brackets_. To calculate tax on an amount of income, calculate the tax from each of the brackets as you progress up to your taxable income. On the other hand, the **average tax rate** is based on the total tax due divided by taxable income. The _alternative minimum tax (AMT)_ is designed to ensure that those who receive tax breaks with high incomes pay at least a minimum amount of tax. Tax owed can also be reduced by a **tax credit** which is an amount subtracted from the amount of taxes owed. This can be given for something like child care. Low-income workers benefit from _earned income credit (EIC)_ which is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers who have a job. There are more tax credits for education, adoption, and retirement savings.
1. Making Tax Payments - you can pay taxes through payroll withholding or through estimated tax payments:
    * **withholding** - the pay-as-you-earn system of tax payments. Employers withhold federal income taxes from your paycheck and send it to the IRS. At the end of the year you get a W2 which reports your annual earnings and the amount deducted for income/social security/state income tax. 
    * **estimated payments** - These people pay during the year and are based on a person's estimate of taxes due at year-end. These are made by self-employed people, those with investment income, and those with other income not subject to withholding.

    ![computing taxable income](images/computing-taxable-income.png)

### Filing your Federal Income Tax Return

Who must file? 

Every citizen of the US must file taxes. This amount is based on the person's _filing status_. There are 5 categories:
1. Single
1. Married, filing joint return
1. Married, filing separate return
1. Head of household
1. Qualifying widow or widower

the _marriage penalty_ occurs for couples that have simliar income levels, and is an additional tax that couples pay filing as _married, filing jointly_ compared to filing as _single_.

What tax forms and schedules should you use? - the Tax Cuts and Job Act simplified the form when filing your taxes, as there's now one for (1040) to report your cumulative income.

Completing the federal income tax return:

1. Filing status - determine your filing status
1. Income - earnings from employment and other income
1. Adjustments to income - can deduct contributions to an IRA
1. Taxable income - your adjusted gross income is reduced by your itemized deductions or by the standard deduction for your tax situation. 
1. Other taxes - any special taxes
1. Tax credits - any tax credits are subtracted
1. Payments - total withholding and other payments
1. Refund or amount you owe - if your payments exceed the amount you owe, you are entitled to a refund. 
1. Signature

If you made an error, file a 1040X to pay additional tax/obtain a refund. 

Don't forget to file state income tax!

### Tax Planning Strategies

People practice **tax avoidance** which is the use of legitimate methods to reduce taxes (in contrast to illegal **tax evasion**). 

Here are some general strategies to avoid taxes:
1. If you have the same or lower tax rate next year, accelerate deductions into the current year. Pay real estate property taxes early, make charitable contributions, etc.
1. If you expect to have lower or the same tax next year, delay the recipes of income until next year, as it will be taxed at a lower rate.
1. If you expect to have a higher tax rate next year, consider _delaying deductions_ since they will have a greater impact on your taxes next year.
1. If you expect to have a higher tax rate next year, consider _accelerating income_ into the current year.

Special Tax Situations
1. Business in your home - deduct ordinary expenses relating to your business, which could include your home/mortgage
1. Divorced persons - child support payments have no tax consequences. 
1. Single parents - can claim _head of household_ filing status 
1. Retired persons - can withdrawal tax-deferred funds without penalty (over 59.5)

Consumer purchasing affects your taxes:
1. Place of Residence - owning a home is a tax shelter - real estate property taxes and interest on mortgage are deductible.
1. Consumer Debt - tax laws allow homeowners to borrow for consumer purchases. You can deduct interest on loans (up to 100k). 
1. Health Care Expenses - _Flexible spending accounts (FSAs)_ allow you to reduce your taxable income when paying for medical or child care costs. _Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)_ are another type of health savings account that allows you to reduce your taxable income when paying for medical expenses.

Investment Decisions 
1. Tax-Exempt investments - interest from bonds are tax-exempt. 
1. Tax-deferred investments
    * _tax deferred annuities_ - allow you to postpone taxes on your investment earnings until you withdraw the money.
    * _section 529 savings plans_ - state run tax-deferred plans to set aside moeny for a child's education
    * _Retirement plans_ - such as an IRA, Keogh or 401(k) allow you to postpone taxes on your investment earnings until you withdraw the money.
1. Capital gains and losses - a _capital gain_ is the profit from the sale of assets such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. YOu only pay taxes once the asset is sold A _capital loss_ is the sale of an investment for less than its purchase price. Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. 
1. Self employment - you can write off home costs as a business expense.
1. Children's Investments - _income shifting_ allows you to shift income to children who are in a lower tax bracket.

Retirement and Education Plans
1. Traditional IRA - contributions are tax deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.
1. Roth IRA - allows a $6k annual contribution which is not tax deducitble but the earnings on the account are tax free after five years and after age 59.5
1. Coverdell Education Savings Account - assists parents to pay for children's education.

## [Chapter 3: Money Management Strategy: Financial Statements and Budgeting](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/368356?module_item_id=843056)

### LO3-1: Successful Money Management

**Money management** refers to the day-to-day financial activities necessary to manage current personal economic resources while working toward long-term financial security. 

Opportunity Cost and Money Management: 
- current spending reduces money available for long-term saving and investing
- increased saving/investing lowers what you can spend now
- credit payments over time reduce future income available for spending and saving
- using savings to buy things results in lost interest and not being able to use savings for other things
- comparison shopping results in wiser buying but loses your time. 

![Money Management Activities](images/money-management-activities.png)

Personal records system: reciepts, credit cards, insurance policies, and tax forms report personal financial activities. Organizing a system provides:
1. handling daily activities like bill paying
1. measuring financial progress
1. completing tax forms
1. making investment decisions
1. determining resources for spending. 

Where to keep financial records:

![keeping-financial-records](images/keeping-financial-records.png)

Important records should be stored in a **safe deposit box** which is a private storage area at a financial institution with maximum security for valuable and difficult-to-replace documents. It requires two keys. 

If you are storing records electronically, you should:
1. Download copies to local storage
1. Back up files externally to cloud or to a hdd
1. secure data with encryption
1. Scan copies of documents you need with paper versions. 

You should keep certificates like wills, birth certs, and social security data. You should keep investment records loins term and tax records for at least three years. 

### LO3-2: Personal Financial Statements

_personal financial statments_ are the starting point for your financial jouirnet. They are documents that provide information on your current financila position and a summary of income spending. Their main purpose is to:
    * report current financial position based on the value of items you own and amounts you owe
    * Measure your progress toward financial goals
    * Maintain information about your financial activities
    * Provide data for preparing tax forms or applying for credit

A _balance sheet_, otherwise known as a _net worth statement_ or _statement of financial position_ reports what you own and whawt you owe. For example:

$$\text{Items of value (what you own)} - \text{Amounts owed (what you owe)} = \text{Net worth (your wealth)}$$

Listing items of Value:
* **assets** are cash or other tanigble property with a monetary value. 
    * Liquid assets are cash items and items of value that can quickly be converted to cash. 
    * Real estate includes a home, apartment, or other land that a person/family owns
    * Personal possessions are a major portion of assets for many people. These include cars, furniture, appliances, jewelry, etc. These are usually hard to convert to cash. 
    * INvestment assets are funds set aside for long-term financial needs.

Determine Amounts Owed:
* **Liabilites** are amounts owed to others but do not include items yet due, such as next month's rent. 
    * Current Liabilities - debts you must pay within a short time, less than a year. 
    * Long-term liabilities - debts you do not have to pay in full until more than a year from now. A _mortgage_ is an amount borrowed to buy a house or other real estate paid over 15 years or more.

Compute Net Worth

$$\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \text{Net Worth}$$

**insolvency** is the inability to pay debts when they are due, when their liabilities exceeded available assets. Actions to increase net worth include increasing savings, reducing spending, increasing value of investments/possessions, and reducing amounts owed. 

Cash Flow Statement - **cash flow** is the actual inflow and outflow of cash during a time period. Income is the most prominent _inflow_ of cash, whereas payments like food/rent are cash _outflows_. 

A Cash flow statement, also known as a _personal income and expenditure statement_ is a summary of cash receipts and payments for a time period.  Deposits are _inflows_, and purchases are _outflows_. 

To prepare a cash flow statement:
1. Record income - _income_ is the inflows of cash for a person/individual/household. **Take home pay** and _net pay_ is a person's income after taxes and other deductions. **discretionary income** is money left over after paying for a house, food, and other necessities. 
1. Record cash outflows:
    * _fixed expenses_: payments that don't vary from month to month. Rent, mortgage, loans, wifi service, etc. 
    * _variable expenses_: food, clothing, utilities, recreation, etc. 
1. Determine net cash flow. This can either be a positive (_surplus_) or negative (_deficit_). Set aside money for an _emergency fund_. 

Ratios for Evaluating Financial Progress:

|Ratio| Calculation | example | interpretation | 
|---|---|---|---|
Debt ratio | liabilities divided by assets | $25000 / 50000 = 0.5$ | shows relationship between debts and assets, a low debt ratio is best. |
Current ratio | liquid assets divided by current liabilities | $4000/2000 = 2 | indicates 2 dollars in liquid assets for every 1 dollar of current liabilities. |
Liquidity ratio | liquid assets divided by monthly expenses | $10000 / 4000 = 2.5 | indicates the number of months in which living expenses can be paid if an emergency comes up, a high liquidity ratio is good. | 
|debt-payments ratio | monthly credit payments divided by take-home pay | $540 / 3600 = 0.15 | how much of a person's earnings goes for debt payments| 
Savings Ratio | Amount saved each month divided by gross income | $648 / 5400 = 0.12 | financial advisors recommended monthly savings of 5-10%. |


### LO3-3: Budgeting for Skilled Money Management

An _achiever_ is a personal with a strong financial base whereas an _explorer_ is a person seeking to get to the next level of financial success. A _striver_ is a personal with minimal financial resources. 

A _budget_ is a spending plan necessary for financial planning. It serves the purpose of:
1. Living with your income
1. Spending money wisely
1. reaching financial goals
1. Preparing for financial emergencies
1. develop wise financial management goals. 

![Creating Making Budget](images/creating-making-budget.png)

Budgeting Process:
1. Set Financial Goals - Your goals should take a SMART approach and nbe specific to who you are (single, married, single parent). You should be aided by your _balance sheet_ reporting your current financial position, your _cash flow_ reporting your inflows and outflows, and your _budget_ setting a plan for spending and saving. 
1. Estimate Income - Estimate it usually monthly (or usually whenever you get paid). 
1. Budget an emergency fund and savings - Financial advisors suggest an _emergency fund_ of 3-6 months for living expenses in bad times. Also, _sinking funds_ are for non-monthly expenses that occur during the year. People also can put these funds into separate savings accounts, called _savings buckets_. The time value of money refers to increases in savings as a result of interest earned. 
1. Budget fixed expenses - Define A budget involves both fixed expenses and _projected_ income/expenses. 
1. Budget Variable Expenses - You can look at the CPI. 
1. Record spending amounts - A **budget variance** is the difference between the amount of budget and the actual amount received/spent. 
1. Reviewing Spending and Savings Patterns - Budgeting is an ongoing progress. 

Characteristics of a good budget:
* Well planned - take time and learn lessons. 
* Realistic - A budget is not to prevent you from enjoyingl ife but also won't let you immediately get a car. 
* Flexible - be prepared for unexpected circumstances
* Clearly Communicated - Should be available and understood by all family members.

Types of Budgeting Systems
1. Mental budget - a budget that is not written down but kept in mind. can be dangerous if you forget.
1. Physical budget - involves physical ways to hold money and tracking. 
1. a written budget contains a plan and a budget record book
1. digital budget - created with a spreadsheet and other financial institutions offer budgeting tools.

### LO3-4: Money Management and Achieving Financial Goals

You can achieve financial statements with:
1. A balance sheet - where you are now
1. A cash flow statement detailing income and spending during a month
1. A budget recording plans for spending/saving your financial goals.

Identifying Saving Goals - common uses for saving reasons include:
* Create an emergency fund
* pay for expensive items like appliances, cars, or to make a down payment on a house
* Buy expensive items
* long-term expenses like education for children
* Earn income from interest on savings

To expand saving, use payroll deductions to automatically deposit money into a savings account, save 5-10% of your income, and take advantage of employer retirement funds.

## [Chapter 2: Financial Aspects of Career Planning](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/365279)

### LO2-1: Career Choice Factors

The lifework you select is key to financial wel-being and personal satisfaction. You may obtain a **job**, an employment position obtained mainly to earn money. You may also select a **career**, a commitment to a profession that requires continued training for professional growth. 

Trade-offs of career decisions:

Your employment most likely effects most of what you do. This includes time, business associates, income, etc. Career choices often involve opportunity costs based off of personal, social, and economic factors. 

The level of formal training also affects financial success. For example, more education increases your _potential_ earning power and reduces your _potential_ for unemployment, along with other factors. 

![Educational Attainment](images/eduational-attainment.png)

People can also market themselves with _employability skills_, also called _transferrable skills_ which refer to basic capabilities that are needed for obtaining, maintaining, and advancing a career. Your readiness can be put into two categories:

1. **technical skills**: _hard skills_ are needed for a specific profession - including IT, accounting, law, engineering, health care, etc.
1. **general skills**: _soft skills_ are needed in all careers/work situations, and can be acquired through school or also work experience. They include but aren't limited to:
    * Work well with others
    * take initiative to overcome obstacles
    * An interest in learning
    * Willingness to cope with conflict
    * etc.

A career can be influenced by personal factors. _Aptitudes_ are natural abilites that people possess, such as artistic, mechanical, or mathematical. _Interest inventories_ determine activities that give you satisfaction in various work situations. 

Career decision-making is important, and having a good approach to career planning, advancement, and change can help you make good decisions. 

![Career Planning Advancement](images/career-planning-advancement.png)

### LO2-2: Career Opportunities: Now and in the Future

Your job search should start with an assesment of the career choice factors shown below:
1. Social influences - demographic trends, geographic trends
    * Demographic trends - the people around you demand certian things and thus create jobs.
    * Geographic trends - consider salary levels and costs of living.
    * Cost of living differences: 

    $$\frac{\text{City 1}}{\text{City 2}} = \frac{\text{index number} \times \text{Salary}}{\text{index number}} = \text{buying power}$$

    For example, a person earning $30,000 in Omaha, Nebraska would need to earn $39,550 in Chicago to have comparable buying power. 

1. Economic conditions - interest rates, inflation, demand
    * INterest rates, price fluctuations, or changing global demand for goods and services affect career opportunities, most of which are out of your control.
1. Industry trends - foreign competition, changing uses of technology. Most industries that have the greatest potential for employment are:
    * _Technology_ - analyst, engineer, cloud admin, web dev, service tech, DevOps
    * _Health Care_ - nurse, physician, therapist, pharmacist, medical assistant, medical records
    * _Medical Technology_ - medical lab tech, medical records, medical billing
    * _Environmental Services_ - environmental engineer, environmental scientist, environmental technician
    * _Business Services_ - accountant, auditor, financial analyst, HR specialist, marketing specialist, management analyst
    * _Social Services_ - social worker, counselor, teacher, child care worker, clergy
    * _Marketing, sales, retailing_ - sales rep, sales manager, retail sales, marketing manager, marketing research
    * _Hospitality/Food Services_ - chef, cook, food prep, waiter, bartender, hotel manager
    * _Education_ - teacher, administrator, librarian, coach, counselor
    * _Financial Services_ - accountant, auditor, financial analyst, financial manager, loan officer

### LO2-3: Employment Search Strategies

Obtaining Employment Services
1. _Part-Time Employment_: summer/part-time is important to get into a career field and get work experience.
1. _Volunteer Work_: Involve in community organizations and projects.
1. _Internships_: In competitive fields, they can give needed expertise and contacts for available jobs. 
1. _Campus Projects_: Clubs, public speaking, planning, finances, etc.

Career Information Sources:

![Career Information Sources](images/career-information-sources.png)

* Career Dev Office - campuses offer this to help with Resume, cover letter, interview prep, and helps to also connect with a network.
* Networking - the process of making and using contact to obtain and update career information. The main sources of networks include community orgs, professional associations, business contacts, and social media.

For effective networking, you should:
1. Prepare a 30 second elevator pitch
1. Ask questions to learn about others
1. Volunteer at events of professional organizations. 

Yu can get an _informational interview_ which is a meeting at which you gather information about a career or organization. To prep for this, you can:
* Prepare a list of industries you'd like to work in and contacts within them
* Prep open-ended questions
* Make the appointment for a 20 minute meeting strictly about information
* interact and talk about work environment
* follow up with a nice email.

Career Planning Strategy:

![Career Planning Strategy](images/career-planning-strategy.png)

To communicate online, you can:
* Get on LinkedIn
* Maintain a professional image
* Use keyworks that describe your skills in your industry
* Don't post your resume online arbitrarily
* Follow-up with regular contacts
* Don't join online groups that are not professional/you won't participate in 
* Create a blog

Career fairs can help, which allow you to quickly communicate your potential contributions to an organization. 

Employment agencies match job hunters with prospective employers. These are for profit, so be careful. Also be aware of government-supported employment agencies.

Note that you can also employ **job creation** - developing an employment position that matches your skills with the needs of an organization.

To apply for employment, it involves 3 main elements:
1. **Resume**: a summary of education, training, experience, and qualifications for employers
1. **Cover Letter**: a letter that accompanies a resume, introducing the applicant to a prospective employer
1. **Interview**: formal meeting to discuss a job candidate's qualifications.

### LO2-4: Financial and Legal Aspects of Employment

When accepting a position, do additional research about duties and expectations and other factors:

1. The work environment - _corporate culture_ refers to management styles, work intensity, dress codes, and social interactions in an organization. 
1. Factors affecting salary - to improve your value and enhance salary potential, ask your supervisor for development suggestions, obtain training, expand duties, exceed expectations, and talk with co-workers to contribute to organizational success. 

    To negotiate salary, you should: 
    1. Research comparable positions 
    1. Prepare evidence of your contributions
    1. Plan the appropriate time and message for your meeting w/the supervisor
    1. Emphasize the value of your work for your employer. 

1. Meeting employee needs - non-salary benefits are incredibly important in companies. this includes child care, elder care, and other things that care for varied life situations. **flexible employee benefit programs** (cafeteria-style benefits) allow workers to base job benefits based on a credit system and personal needs. Others have _flexible spending plans_ otherwise known as _expense reimbursement accounts_ where you set aside some of your salary to pay for medical expenses that are not subject to income/social security tax. Others offer a _medical-savings account_ (MSA) or a _health savings account_ (HSA) to enable account holders to pay health care costs with pretax dollars. 

Some employers offer a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) or for nonprofits, 403(b). All qualified plans must be 100% vested on completion of 5 years of service or (2) have 20% vesting after 3 years and full vesting in stages after 7 years. 

To compare benefits, there are 2 methods:
1. _Market value_: monetary value of an employee benefit, the cost if you had to pay it to them.
1. _Future value calculations_: assess the long-term worth of employee benefits like a retirement plan.

You should also consider a _tax-exempt_ benefit so that you don't have to pay income tax, or _tax deferred_ benefits where you pay income tax at the time of retirement. To calculate tax-equivalent employee benefits:

$$\frac{\text{Value of the benefit}}{1 - \text{tax rate}}$$

YOu can also calculate the _after tax value_ of an employee benefit with $\text{taxable value of the benefit} (1- \text{Tax rate})$. 

Make sure you are aware of your employment rights. For example, you cannot be refused to be hired because you're a pregnant woman or have a disability. You cannot be discriminated against on age, race, color, religion, sex, etc. Minimum-wage and overtime pay legislation apply to individuals in certain work settings. Worker's compensation like Social Security and unemployment insurance are required. 

### LO2-5: Long-Term Career Development

Every day you take actions that contribute to career success. This can include:
* Working well with others
* Flexibility and openness
* Developing efficient work habits
* Learning to anticipate problems and solve them creatively

Training Opportunities: many careers have formal training methods like programs, seminars, and webinars. Informal methods include reading and discussion with colleagues and online courses. 

Career Paths and Development:

You will likely move through _stages_ of your career. A **mentor** is an experienced employee who serves as a teacher and counselor for less-experienced people in a career field. 

![Career Development](images/career-progress.png)

Changing Careers

Changing jobs can be more difficult than selecting your first job. This must include an assessment of financial and personal costs along with benefits based on your goals. 












## [Chapter 1: Personal Finance Basics and the Time Value of Money](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu/courses/74463/assignments/365263?module_item_id=836815)

### LO1-1: The Financial Planning Process

Both financial and personal satisfaction is a result of an organized process called _personal money management_ or _personal financial planning_. 

Personal financial planning is the process of managing your money to achieve personal economic satisfaction. 

_Financial literacy_ is the use of knowledge and skills for earning, saving, spending and investing money to achieve personal, family, and community goals, which includes developing attitudes, behaviors, and competencies to meet current and future financial obligations. 

Personal financial activities generally fall under three categories: 

1. Spending - daily expenses, activites
1. Saving - for emergencies/long-term security
1. Sharing - for local/global causes

THe financial planning process below is:

![Financial Planning Process](images/financial-planning.png)

1. Determine your current financial situation
    - Determine your income, savings, living expenses, and debts. Maintaining a record is important. 
1. Develop Financial Goals
    - YOu need to identify how you feel about money and why, and are your feelings based on knowledge or influence? How will the economy affect your goals? 
1. ID Alternative Courses of Action
    - _continue the same action_
    - _expand the current situation_
    - _change the current situation_
    - _take a new course of action_
1. Evaluate your alternatives
    - Evaluate personal values and life situation and the ways in which your financial goals and alternatives match your values and situation.
    - Consequences of Choice: _opportunity cost_ is the cost of passing up the next best choice when making a decision. So you may invest in a stock but not go on a vacation.
    - Evaluating Risk: Identifying risk is difficult but necessary. Risk can include:
        * Inflation Risk - rising/falling prices resulting in a gain/loss of buying power. 
        * Interest Rate Risk - Changing interest rates affect your costs when you borrow/invest. Borrowing at a low interest rate can be to your advantage when rates are rising. 
        * Income Risk - The loss of a job may result from changes in technology. 
        * Personal Risk - This can include health risks, safety risks, and additional costs from financial decisions.
        * Liquidity Risk - The inability to convert assets into cash without a loss in value.
1. Create and Implement your Action Plan
1. Review and Revise your plan


The three main sources of info for financial planning are the media, financial institutions, and financial planners.

### LO1-2: Influences on Personal Financial Planning

An _ecosystem_ is a network of activities and interconnections. Elements of the personal finance ecosystem include life situation, personal values, the financial system, and economic factors.

Life situation and Personal Values

- Life situation/lifestyle changes from several factors. the **adult life cycle** - the stages in the family situation and financial needs of an adult - influences decisions. In addition, your **values** - the ideals and principles you consider important/desireable influence what you spend money on. 

- The Financial System/Economic Factors: money in the economy flows from providers of funds to users of funds through intermediaries and markets. 
    * a _security_ is a financial instrument that represents debt or equity.
    * _debt securities_ (such as bonds) represent money borrowed by companies or governments.
    * _equity securities_ (such as stocks) represent ownership in a company.
    * _economics_ is the study of how wealth is created and distributed.
    * _The Fed_ is the Federal Reserve System which is the central bank of the US that maintains the money supply, regulates financial institutions, and controls the availability of credit.

![Financial System/Economic Factors](images/financial-system.png)

- Global Influences: The global economy can affect our personal finances. It is affected by foreign investors and competition in markets. For example, when the value of US made goods is loiter than imported goods, more US dollars leave the country than the amount of foreign currency coming in. This is called a _trade deficit_. Some try to impose _tariffs_ to counteract this. 

- Economic COnditions

Economic conditions that influence personal finance are:

|Economic Factor| What it Measures| How it influences Financial Planning|
|---|---|---|
Consumer Prices | the buying power of the dollar, inflation | if prices rise faster than income you can't purchase the same amount of goods/services.
Consumer Spending | the demand for goods and services by individuals and households | Increased consumer spending usually creates more jobs/wages, high levels of consumer spending may push up interest rates/prices. 
Interest Rates | the cost of money - the cost of credit when you borrow; the return on money when you save or invest | High interest rates make buying on credit more expensive; higher interest rates make saving and investing more attractive and may discourage borrowing
Money Supply | The dollars available for people to spend | Interest rates tend to decline as more people save and invest, but higher saving may also reduce job opportunities. 
Unemployment | The number of people without jibs who are also willing to work | Unemployed people should reduce spending and may need to access their emergency fund, high unemployment may reduce consumer spending and job opps. 
Housing starts | the number of new homes being built | Increasing home building creates jobs, higher wages, more spending, and economic expansion. 
GDP | Total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders | Measures economic viability of a country resulting in jobs and opportunities for increased personal wealth
Trade balance | difference between exports and imports | If exports > imports, the balance of trade deficit is favorable. If imports > exports, the balance of trade deficit is unfavorable.
DJA, S&P 500, NASDAQ  | the relative value of stocks represented by the index | indicate general movement of stock prices. 

- Consumer Prices - _inflation_ is the general rise in prices. _deflation_ is the general decrease in prices. _disinflation_ is the general slowing of price increases. Inflation is caused by an increase in demand without an increase in supply. It is harmful to people on fixed incomes. It can also affect lenders of money. For example, if you pay 4% interest on a loan and the inflation rate is 6%, the dollars you pay the lender have lost buying power; the lender is losing money.
    * Rule of 72: to determine how long it will take for prices to double, divide 72 by the inflation rate.

- _CPI_ - Consumer Price Index - measures the change in prices of goods/services over time. It is used to measure inflation on a market basket of goods. 

- Interest Rates - the cost of money. WHen consimer saving and investing increase the supply of money, interest rates tend to decline. When consumer spending increases, the demand for money increases and interest rates tend to rise.

### LO1-3: Developing Personal Financial Goals

There are two major factors that change your financial plans - the time frame in which you want to achieve your goals, and the financial need that drives your goals.

- Timing: 
    1. Short Term Goals - vacation, small debts, something within a year. 
    1. Intermediate Goals - 1-5 years.a
    1. Long Term Goals - 5+ years, such a retirement, funding education, a home. 

Within timing, you need to have some goal-setting guidelines. You can take the "SMART" Approach - 
    - S: Specific
    - M: Measurable
    - A: Action-Oriented
    - R: Realistic
    - T: Time-Based

### LO1-4: Opportunity Costs and the Time Value of Money

Opportunity cost is the cost of passing up the next best choice when making a decision.

![Opportunity Cost](images/opportunity-cost-financial.png)

- Personal Opportunity Costs: A valuable personal opp cost involves time. This can include time spent on a job, time spent on leisure activities, and time spent on personal finance activities. And it can also include physical habits. 
- Financial Opportunity Costs: The _time value of money_ evaluates increases in an amount of money as a result of interest earned. 
- Interest Calculations: Three amounts are required to calculate the time value of money: 
    1. The amount of money invested or borrowed
    1. The interest rate
    1. The length of time the money is invested or borrowed.

![Time Value of Money](images/time-value-of-money.png)

- 5 Methods to calculate time value of money:
    1. _Formula Calculation_: Image above
    1. _time Value of money tables_
    1. _Financial Calculator_
    1. _Spreadsheet_
    1. _Websites/Apps_

**see ch1 appendix for information on all of these formulas**

- Future value of a single amount: _future value_ is the amount to which current savings will grow based on a certain interest rate and a certain time period. The formula is $FV = PV(1 + i)^n$ where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
