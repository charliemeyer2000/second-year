### LO1-1: The Financial Planning Process

Both financial and personal satisfaction is a result of an organized process called _personal money management_ or _personal financial planning_. 

Personal financial planning is the process of managing your money to achieve personal economic satisfaction. 

_Financial literacy_ is the use of knowledge and skills for earning, saving, spending and investing money to achieve personal, family, and community goals, which includes developing attitudes, behaviors, and competencies to meet current and future financial obligations. 

Personal financial activities generally fall under three categories: 

1. Spending - daily expenses, activites
1. Saving - for emergencies/long-term security
1. Sharing - for local/global causes

THe financial planning process below is:

![Financial Planning Process](images/financial-planning.png)

1. Determine your current financial situation
    - Determine your income, savings, living expenses, and debts. Maintaining a record is important. 
1. Develop Financial Goals
    - YOu need to identify how you feel about money and why, and are your feelings based on knowledge or influence? How will the economy affect your goals? 
1. ID Alternative Courses of Action
    - _continue the same action_
    - _expand the current situation_
    - _change the current situation_
    - _take a new course of action_
1. Evaluate your alternatives
    - Evaluate personal values and life situation and the ways in which your financial goals and alternatives match your values and situation.
    - Consequences of Choice: _opportunity cost_ is the cost of passing up the next best choice when making a decision. So you may invest in a stock but not go on a vacation.
    - Evaluating Risk: Identifying risk is difficult but necessary. Risk can include:
        * Inflation Risk - rising/falling prices resulting in a gain/loss of buying power. 
        * Interest Rate Risk - Changing interest rates affect your costs when you borrow/invest. Borrowing at a low interest rate can be to your advantage when rates are rising. 
        * Income Risk - The loss of a job may result from changes in technology. 
        * Personal Risk - This can include health risks, safety risks, and additional costs from financial decisions.
        * Liquidity Risk - The inability to convert assets into cash without a loss in value.
1. Create and Implement your Action Plan
1. Review and Revise your plan


The three main sources of info for financial planning are the media, financial institutions, and financial planners.

### LO1-2: Influences on Personal Financial Planning

An _ecosystem_ is a network of activities and interconnections. Elements of the personal finance ecosystem include life situation, personal values, the financial system, and economic factors.

Life situation and Personal Values

- Life situation/lifestyle changes from several factors. the **adult life cycle** - the stages in the family situation and financial needs of an adult - influences decisions. In addition, your **values** - the ideals and principles you consider important/desireable influence what you spend money on. 

- The Financial System/Economic Factors: money in the economy flows from providers of funds to users of funds through intermediaries and markets. 
    * a _security_ is a financial instrument that represents debt or equity.
    * _debt securities_ (such as bonds) represent money borrowed by companies or governments.
    * _equity securities_ (such as stocks) represent ownership in a company.
    * _economics_ is the study of how wealth is created and distributed.
    * _The Fed_ is the Federal Reserve System which is the central bank of the US that maintains the money supply, regulates financial institutions, and controls the availability of credit.

![Financial System/Economic Factors](images/financial-system.png)

- Global Influences: The global economy can affect our personal finances. It is affected by foreign investors and competition in markets. For example, when the value of US made goods is loiter than imported goods, more US dollars leave the country than the amount of foreign currency coming in. This is called a _trade deficit_. Some try to impose _tariffs_ to counteract this. 

- Economic COnditions

Economic conditions that influence personal finance are:

|Economic Factor| What it Measures| How it influences Financial Planning|
|---|---|---|
Consumer Prices | the buying power of the dollar, inflation | if prices rise faster than income you can't purchase the same amount of goods/services.
Consumer Spending | the demand for goods and services by individuals and households | Increased consumer spending usually creates more jobs/wages, high levels of consumer spending may push up interest rates/prices. 
Interest Rates | the cost of money - the cost of credit when you borrow; the return on money when you save or invest | High interest rates make buying on credit more expensive; higher interest rates make saving and investing more attractive and may discourage borrowing
Money Supply | The dollars available for people to spend | Interest rates tend to decline as more people save and invest, but higher saving may also reduce job opportunities. 
Unemployment | The number of people without jibs who are also willing to work | Unemployed people should reduce spending and may need to access their emergency fund, high unemployment may reduce consumer spending and job opps. 
Housing starts | the number of new homes being built | Increasing home building creates jobs, higher wages, more spending, and economic expansion. 
GDP | Total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders | Measures economic viability of a country resulting in jobs and opportunities for increased personal wealth
Trade balance | difference between exports and imports | If exports > imports, the balance of trade deficit is favorable. If imports > exports, the balance of trade deficit is unfavorable.
DJA, S&P 500, NASDAQ  | the relative value of stocks represented by the index | indicate general movement of stock prices. 

- Consumer Prices - _inflation_ is the general rise in prices. _deflation_ is the general decrease in prices. _disinflation_ is the general slowing of price increases. Inflation is caused by an increase in demand without an increase in supply. It is harmful to people on fixed incomes. It can also affect lenders of money. For example, if you pay 4% interest on a loan and the inflation rate is 6%, the dollars you pay the lender have lost buying power; the lender is losing money.
    * Rule of 72: to determine how long it will take for prices to double, divide 72 by the inflation rate.

- _CPI_ - Consumer Price Index - measures the change in prices of goods/services over time. It is used to measure inflation on a market basket of goods. 

- Interest Rates - the cost of money. WHen consimer saving and investing increase the supply of money, interest rates tend to decline. When consumer spending increases, the demand for money increases and interest rates tend to rise.

### LO1-3: Developing Personal Financial Goals

There are two major factors that change your financial plans - the time frame in which you want to achieve your goals, and the financial need that drives your goals.

- Timing: 
    1. Short Term Goals - vacation, small debts, something within a year. 
    1. Intermediate Goals - 1-5 years.
    1. Long Term Goals - 5+ years, such a retirement, funding education, a home. 

Within timing, you need to have some goal-setting guidelines. You can take the "SMART" Approach - 
    - S: Specific
    - M: Measurable
    - A: Action-Oriented
    - R: Realistic
    - T: Time-Based

### LO1-4: Opportunity Costs and the Time Value of Money

Opporunity cost is the cost of passing up the next best choice when making a decision.

![Opportunity Cost](images/opportunity-cost-financial.png)

- Personal Opportunity Costs: A valuable personal opp cost involves time. This can include time spent on a job, time spent on leisure activities, and time spent on personal finance activities. And it can also include physical habits. 
- Financial Opportunity Costs: The _time value of money_ evaluates increases in an amount of money as a result of interest earned. 
- Interest Calculations: Three amounts are required to calculate the time value of money: 
    1. The amount of money invested or borrowed
    1. The interest rate
    1. The length of time the money is invested or borrowed.

![Time Value of Money](images/time-value-of-money.png)

- 5 Methods to calculate time value of money:
    1. _Formula Calculation_: Image above
    1. _time Value of money tables_
    1. _Financial Calculator_
    1. _Spreadsheet_
    1. _Websites/Apps_

**see ch1 appendix for information on all of these formulas**

- Future value of a single amount: _future value_ is the amount to which current savings will grow based on a certain interest rate and a certain time period. The formula is $FV = PV(1 + i)^n$ where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
- Future value of a series of deposits: _annuity_ is a series of equal deposits at equal intervals. The formula is $FV = PV \times \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i}$ where FV is the future value, PMT is the amount of each payment, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
- Present value of a series of payments: $PV = Annuity * \frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1 + i)^n}}{i}$ where PV is the present value, Annuity is the amount of each payment, i is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.
- Yearly earnings based on savings and annual interest rate: $Earnings = PV \times i$ where Earnings is the yearly earnings, PV is the present value, and i is the interest rate.
- Rate of increase: calculate the difference between future and present value and divide by the present value.
- Future Value of a series of deposits: an _annuity_ is a series of equal deposits/payments. 
- Present value of a single amount: _present value_ is the current value for a future amount based on a particular interest rate for a certain period of time. 
- Present value of a series of deposits:  calculations that can be used to determine how much you need to deposit now so that you can withdrawal a certain amount for a set number of years.
